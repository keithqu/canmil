Throughout the centuries, Portugal used the territory that became Angola as a source of natural resources, including slaves. In 1961, inspired by uprisings in other African colonies, Angolans rose in a revolt that was crushed by the Portuguese army. Many revolutionaries fled to neighbouring countries where they started their own revolutionary movements, advocating Angolan independence. While there were many groups created, with more splinter groups forming over time, there were three main independence groups. The first independence movement to be formed was the Marxist-influenced Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola, (MPLA - Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola). It had its headquarters in Zambia and had its greatest influence among educated Angolans. The second group was the Frente Nacional para a Libertacao de Angola (FNLA - National Liberation Front of Angola), formed in 1962 by Holden Roberto. Based in Congo, it had contacts in both western and communist countries, but had its greatest support from the Organization of African Unity. The third group was the Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA - National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) formed in 1966 by Jonas Savimbi. These three groups waged a guerrilla war against the Portuguese authorities, forcing that country to keep over 50,000 troops in Angola in the early 1970s. In part because of the cost of the liberation struggles in the Portuguese colonies, a group of Portuguese army officers overthrew the dictatorship, installing a military regime that quickly converted Portugal into a democracy. The military government agreed to Angolan independence, turning the country over to a coalition of the three major liberation movements. This coalition rapidly disintegrated and a civil war resulted. The MPLA remained as the government of Angola, while the other two groups again waged a guerrilla war. The Marxist MPLA received the backing of the Soviet Union, through Cuba, while UNITA received support from South Africa. By the late 1980s, UNITA was in control of large areas of the country, having fought the 40,000 Cubans and the MPLA forces to a standstill. The FNLA had suffered a serious defeat in 1975 from which it never recovered. In December 1988, after negotiations between Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States, an agreement was reached whereby the Cuban forces would withdraw from Angola. UNAVEM II was established by Security Council Resolution 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991 with a mandate to verify the arrangements agreed to by the Angolan parties for the monitoring of the cease-fire, and for the monitoring of the Angolan police during the cease-fire period. The mandate was modified on 24 March 1992, when the Security Council, through Resolution 747, decided to enlarge the mandate of UNAVEM II to include observation and verification of the presidential and legislative elections in Angola. When the cease-fire was violated in October 1992 UNAVEM II's mandate was adjusted, in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 804 of 20 January 1993, 811 of 12 March 1993 and 834 of 1 June 1993. These Resolutions sought to help the two sides reach agreements on completing the peace process and, at the same time, to broker and help implement cease-fires at the national or local level. A new peace agreement was reached on 20 November 1994 through the Lusaka Protocol. The Security Council, through Resolution 952 of 27 October 1994 and Resolution 966 of 8 December 1994, authorized UNAVEM II to verify the initial stages of the peace agreement. In February 1995, the Security Council set up a new mission -- UNAVEM III -- to monitor and verify the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. The United Nations Security Council created the UN Angola Verification Mission I (UNAVEM I) to monitor the Cuban withdrawal, which was completed by May 1991. While this was ongoing, the international community put pressure on the MPLA and UNITA to reach a settlement. Negotiations started in April 1990 with Portugal acting as a mediator and the Soviet Union and United States as observers. An agreement, the Bicesse Accords, was signed in Lisbon, Portugal, on 31 May 1991. A cease-fire came into effect on 15 May 1991, with a letter from the president of Angola to the UN Secretary-General arriving two days later. The letter, requesting UN participation in verifying the implementation of the Bicesse Accords, was not unexpected, and the Secretary-General had a plan in place for UN participation. On 30 May, the Security Council, through Resolution 696, created UNAVEM II, with an expectation that it would be required until 30 November 1992. Up to 350 unarmed military monitors plus civilian police and military medical personnel were authorized, with the first arriving in Angola on 2 June. The UNAVEM II military observers were to assist monitoring groups formed of equal numbers of MPLA and UNITA representatives. The observers deployed to 46 assembly areas where the MPLA and UNITA forces were to gather and have their numbers and weapons counted before being demobilized. Observers were also stationed at several critical areas - airports, border posts and harbours. They would investigate and attempt to resolve violations of the cease-fire, as well as use their good offices to resolve problems between the MPLA and UNITA members of the monitoring groups. Almost from the start, it was the UNMOs who took the lead in conducting the monitoring groups\u2019 duties. They also found themselves providing food to MPLA and UNITA forces as neither organization had the capabilities to support the troops once they were in the assembly areas. Due to mistrust and misunderstandings, and compounded by logistical difficulties, the MPLA and UNITA forces did not assemble as rapidly as scheduled. By October 1991, this part of the plan was seriously behind schedule. Both sides were also cheating on the agreement, turning in old or irreparable weapons, and hiding newer ones around the country. Despite this, there were no major violations of the cease-fire and a request was made of the UN in December 1991 to provide technical assistance for the planned elections and to provide observers to ensure the election was free and fair. After negotiations and creation of a plan by the Secretary-General, the Security Council authorized the election observers in Resolution 747 of 24 March 1992. The vote was scheduled for 29 and 30 September 1992. UNAVEM II military personnel assisted in the deployment and operations of the election observers, while also accelerating the demobilization process in the period before the election. On 1 October, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative declared the elections free and fair. President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA was declared the winner, with UNITA\u2019s Jonas Savimbi almost immediately rejecting the results as obtained by fraud. Tensions increased throughout October, resulting in heavy fighting in the capital Luanda on 31 October and the deaths of two UNMOs killed by UNITA forces. Initially, local cease-fires were arranged and some stability was maintained, but by 21 January 1993, the Secretary-General reported that Angola had returned to a state of civil war. UNAVEM II teams in the field were threatened by this violence, and eventually all were evacuated. The Security Council, through Resolution 804, changed UNAVEM II\u2019s mandate so that its personnel were concentrated in Luanda and working towards a cease-fire. By this time, only a skeleton crew remained as the UNAVEM II contingent. In November 1994, with UNITA on the verge of defeat, Savimbi signed another agreement. The UN sent troops for UNAVEM III. Despite all international efforts, Savimbi broke all cease-fires and agreements he signed. Angola remained in a state of civil war until 2002, at which time he was killed by government forces. UNITA subsequently signed a cease-fire that appears to be holding.", "Name": "PASTEL", "Date": "31 May 1991 - 31 May 1993", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " Canada\u2019s participation in UNAVEM II was initiated by a request from the Secretary-General. On 14 June 1991, the tasking order was issued for Operation PASTEL, as the Canadian Forces participation was called. The CF would send fifteen military observers who would deploy on 21 June. Each observer was posted for one year to the Canadian Contingent UNAVEM (CCUNAVEM). While the UN requested the UNMOs be sent as soon as possible, the situation on the ground only allowed 11 personnel to deploy by the end of June. The remaining four did not deploy until early September. The initial groups of Canadian UNMOs found themselves waiting to be deployed. Some made themselves indispensable at UNAVEM headquarters, helping to straighten out the initial obstacles. A Portuguese-speaking major became Military Assistant to the Chief Military Observer, expanding the job to that beyond simply a personal assistant. Once the initial hurdles were overcome, two Canadians were tasked to serve in UNAVEM headquarters in Luanda. The CCUNAVEM Commander led the UN operations in south-central Angola with half of the remaining officers in this area. The remainder were scattered throughout the country. Canadian officers filled the position of Operations Officer in three of the six regional headquarters, a key position that recognized the capabilities of the Canadians. Rotation of the first set of Canadian observers began in June 1992 and lasted through August. Fourteen officers arrived in the second contingent, with one major being extended for continued employment at UNAVEM headquarters. As with the first contingent, the Canadians were scattered throughout the country and again filled key positions in regional headquarters. With the commencement of fighting on 31 October 1992, the Canadians were able to remain safe. They were, however, cut off from most of the outside world. While most other UN contingents began removing their forces, Canada, Egypt and Senegal remained at full strength to assist the UN in restoring order. The initial operations during the fighting were to get the airport at Luanda opened for evacuation and relief flights, while in other areas, attempts were made at arranging local cease-fires. With the restoration of order in most of Angola by the end of November 1992, the Canadian UNMOs were redeployed, filling even more regional headquarters positions. With the renewal of fighting, UNAVEM personnel reverted to finding shelter, unable to influence either side. During the fighting in mid-January 1993, five Canadians were under fire for at least 24 hours. UNAVEM posts were again evacuated, with some Canadians leaving the country, but on normally scheduled periods of leave and not because of the fighting. Over several weeks, all remaining Canadians were evacuated to Luanda. As a result of the fighting and the evident desire of both sides not to reach a negotiated case-fire, Canada decided that its personnel would not remain in theatre beyond 31 January. Evacuation, however, would take a matter of weeks. The last Canadian officer was withdrawn on 31 May 1993. Overall twenty-nine, Canadian officers served in UNAVEM II, with one being there from the start of the mission until evacuation in February 1993. The end of Canadian participation in UNAVEM did not mean the end of the deployment for some of the Canadian officers. Nine Canadians who remained in theatre on 4 February, but unemployed with the reduction of UNAVEM personnel, indicated that they would volunteer to serve in the new UN mission being created in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). This was gratefully accepted by the Secretary-General, and all nine were deployed to ONUMOZ by 12 February 1993."}}, {"opName": "PRUDENCE", "countryRegion": "Central African Republic", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1998-04-15", "endDate": "1999-10-22", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/prudence.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Central African Republic", "Mission Date": "15 April 1998 - 22 October 1999", "Mission Mandate": " Security Council Resolution 1159 (1998) of March 1998; terminated with UNSCR 1271 on 22 Oct 1999. In 1996, the Central African Republic was shaken by a politico-military crisis, punctuated by three successive mutinies by elements of the Armed Forces. The crisis stemmed to a large extent from widespread public discontent over social and economic problems exacerbated by non-payment of salaries by the Government. Concerned by the situation and its implications for the region, and in view of the request of President Ange-Felix Patasse, the Nineteenth Summit Meeting of Heads of State and Government of France and Africa, held in December 1996, asked the Presidents of Gabon, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali to visit Bangui and mediate a truce between the forces loyal to Present Patasse and the rebels. After prolonged intensive negotiations, the parties signed the Bangui Agreements on 25 January 1997, which contained the necessary elements for a comprehensive settlement including an inter-African force in the Central African Republic (MISAB). Formed on 31 January 1997, MISAB\u2019s mandate was aimed at restoring peace and security by monitoring the implementation of the Bangui Agreements and conducting operations to disarm the former rebels, the militia and all other unlawfully armed individuals. On 8 February 1997, MISAB was deployed in Bangui, comprising a total of some 800 troops from Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon and Mali, and later from Senegal and Togo, under the military command of Gabon and with the logistical and financial support of France. Acting under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, members of the MISAB and those providing logistical support were authorized to ensure the security and freedom of movement of their personnel. In November 1997, the Secretary-General made recommendations on further international support after the mandate of MISAB was due to expire. Although the Member States participating in MISAB were willing to continue to assist the Central African Republic in consolidating the peace, they did not have the capacity to do so alone, as France was preparing to withdraw all its troops, and consequently its logistical support from the mission by mid-April 1998. The Secretary-General subsequently recommended the establishment and deployment of another peacekeeping operation authorized by the international community. Under UNSCR 1159 (1998) the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) came into effect from 15 April 1998.

The twenty-two flights undertaken as part of MALLARD normally took about forty-one hours, thirty-four of them in the air, and altogether they carried 194 Army and six RCAF personnel, 87 tons of stores and equipment, six jeeps and three trailers. Because of the length of the trip, additional aircrew (slip crews) were stationed along the flight path at Dakar and Lajes. A North Star would leave Trenton and fly to Lajes in the Azores via Gander. In Lajes, the crew would be replaced by another who would fly the aircraft to Dakar. A third crew would take over and fly to L\u00e9opoldville via Accra. A round trip for an aircraft was four days, while for the aircrew it was six to eight days.

Although ONUC was organized relatively quickly, it could not keep pace with events. Belgian troops protecting Belgian citizens were not about to leave just because they had been asked to do so, especially not from the secessionist province of Katanga, whose government had asked that they stay. And the UN would not countenance the use of its contingents to force Katanga to return to the Congolese fold: it would not, at this stage, become involved in what was essentially a civil war. Unsatisfied in particular with the UN\u2019s attitude to Katanga, Lumumba called upon the USSR for assistance and on the UN to withdraw, and with Soviet help flew the Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise (ANC) to Kasai where, for the moment, it ruthlessly put down the secessionist movement. But when the ANC tried next to move on Katanga, ONUC stepped in. There was now a fundamental fracture in the Congolese leadership, and much to its distaste, the UN had to take sides. With UN and US encouragement, ANC's chief of staff, Colonel Joseph Mobutu, expelled Lumumba\u2019s Czech and Soviet advisers and then, cooperating with President Kasavubu, saw to Lumumba\u2019s departure from the capital. Flown to Elizabethville, Katanga, on 17 January 1961, President Lumumba and his aides were beaten by the ANC, Katangan gendarmes, and Belgian mercenaries before they eventually died while still in custody. Lumumba\u2019s death, publicly explained as the result of an escape attempt, provoked demonstrations throughout Europe and North America, and led Egypt, Indonesia, Yugoslavia, and other states to withdraw their troops from ONUC. Within the Congo, meanwhile, there developed four regionally and tribal-based factions and centres of power: the secessionist governments of Katanga and Kasai, and two national governments at Leopoldville and Stanleyville. The rivalry among them was intense, violence spread, and all, at times, provoked and assaulted UN troops trying to maintain order. Unwilling to fail in its mandate to see a unified and stable regime for the whole of the Congo, ONUC responded. It launched a surprise attack into Katanga on 28 August 1961, which achieved initial success, but Katangan counter-attacks caused casualties among UN personnel and led to the capture of an Irish infantry company. Secretary-General Hammarskjold undertook to fly to Katanga to negociate with Tshombe, but died in a plane crash on 18 September. Soon thereafter, the UN was forced to accept a humiliating cease-fire, but it did not withdraw its troops from the province. Violence flared again in December. Now with its own small air force - the Katangans had one operational fighter-bomber aircraft of their own - the UN successfully took control of Elizabethville and caused the Katangan rebels to flee. But it had not stamped out secessionism altogether. That would not occur until December 1962-January 1963 when, after four days of constant harassment, ONUC launched a swift and highly successful attack, forced Tshombe to flee and, finally, to surrender, renounce secession, and demobilize his troops. Having already settled the secessionist problem in Kasia, the UN had achieved important objectives in terms of its original mandate: the Congo was whole again.

They would move to the Congo as part of Operation MALLARD beginning that same day, with the entire group scheduled to be in theatre by 29 August. As often happened, however, the first Canadians in the Congo were borrowed from other UN missions. Eight army officers came from UNTSO and UNEF, while eleven RCAF officers who arrived early were employed at ONUC headquarters. One, Air Commodore F. Carpenter, was the air advisor to Major General von Horn, the ONUC commander. The first signallers of what would become 57 Canadian Signals Unit arrived on 12 August. The main body arrived over the next two months, bringing the total to 275 - a significant drain on the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. Of these, 215 were located at ONUC Headquarters in Leopoldville. The rest manned signals detachments in Albertville, Bukavu, Coquihatville, Elizabethville, Goma, Kamina, Kindu, Kongola, Luluabourg, Matadi, and Stanleyville. Far-flung and isolated, they depended on other UN contingents for their security. The RCAF, meanwhile, would conduct twice-weekly supply flights from Pisa, Italy to Leopoldville as well as twice-monthly support and personnel rotation flights for the Canadian Army. Paid for by Canada, the former were suspended in 1962 due to budget cuts. In theatre, the permanent air force contribution to ONUC settled down to seven officers and eight airmen at headquarters, with another eight airmen supporting the Canadian airlift. It would grow in September 1961 when the UN asked Canada for two C-119 Boxcars and a dozen air control technicians to assist with UN fighter operations against the Katangan rebels. That added seventy-three officers and men to the contingent for a few weeks. Wherever Canadians served, given the Congo\u2019s colonial past, French-speaking officers were at a premium, and by 1962 sixteen francophones held key positions in the UN hierarchy. The threat of violence was everywhere. As early as 18 August 1960 four of the first Canadians to arrive had been manhandled by ANC troops and had to be rescued by Ghanaians. A similar incident occurred five weeks later in Stanleyville. Then, in February 1961 two Canadian officers were beaten, kicked and robbed and their weapons taken. That led to a change in the mission\u2019s Rules of Engagement on 2 March: henceforth, Canadians were authorized to shoot to defend themselves. Several days later the signals detachment at Matadi was attacked by ANC troops., After fierce fighting that lasted several hours, the Canadians surrendered, while the Sudanese troops protecting them fled. Fortunately, the Canadians were released the next day. In total, four Canadians received commendations for bravery. Although the UN started to reduce its commitment to ONUC in 1963, the Canadian contingent did not reduce commensurately in size. By September 1963 about 8,000 UN personnel remained in the Congo, down from over 20,000 in June 1961, but since they were responsible for communications throughout the mission the UN asked that the Canadian signalers remain until the end. Accordingly, the last rotation of Canadian personnel occurred on 22 March 1964. RCAF flights on 27 May, 17, 27 and 30 June repatriated the last remaining Canadians. In all, about 1800 Army and 110 RCAF personnel served in the Congo, with an average of about three hundred in the country at any one time."}}, {"opName": "(Congo 1960)", "countryRegion": "Congo", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1960-07-19", "endDate": "1960-08-17", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/congo-1960.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Congo 1960", "International Mission Name": "Congo 1960", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Congo", "Mission Date": "18 July 1960 - 17 August 1960", "Mandate": "To deliver humanitarian assistance to Congo and evacuate Canadians", "Mission Notes": " As a result of the breakdown in transportation system in the Congo, food became scarce in many inland areas. On 15 July, the United Nations asked the international community for food aid. Air Transport Command alerted No. 426 Squadron with its North Star aircraft, pending Cabinet approval. This was forthcoming on 16 July, with the announcement that the RCAF would fly 20,000 lbs of canned pork and 20,000 lbs of whole milk powder to the Congo. The North Stars would also evacuate refugees, with priority being given to Canadian citizens. The food shipments arrived in Trenton on the 17th and 18th. Forty-five minutes after approval was given to proceed on the 18th, the first North Star was underway, with three others following. They reached L\u00e9opoldville on July 21st having delivered 23,584 lbs of pork and 20,570 lbs of powdered milk. While the aircraft were enroute, the UN asked the Canadian government if they could borrow the North Stars to ferry troops between Europe and Congo, and if they could carry food instead of refugees. The Cabinet approved both requests on the 21st. On the 23rd and 24th, the three North Stars flew a total of nine flights to Luluabourg, a three-hour flight east of L\u00e9opoldville. Tunisian troops were flown east, and refugees were brought back on each flight. The internal transport of troops within the Congo was not authorized, and both the Minister of External Affairs and the Minister of National Defence quickly sent telegrams ending this aspect of the humanitarian flights. As the UN did not have an immediate requirement for transport external to the Congo, the North Stars were idle, the last eventually leaving for Canada on 12 August. These aircraft were then used for Operation MALLARD, the airlift of Canadian military personnel to the Congo (see separate entry).\n\nThe UN asked for Canadian humanitarian airlift assistance on one further occasion in the early part of the Congo operation.

The UN had hardly departed when the Simba rebels attempted to create their own state in eastern Congo. The Congolese military was an ineffective entity, wracked with patronage and nepotism. Moise Tshombe, former secessionist leader of Katanga and now newly installed Prime Minister, hired mercenaries to lead the army in putting down the Simbas. These mercenaries included \u201cMad Mike\u201d Hoare, Robert Denard and Jean Schramme, a Belgian plantation owner who had lived 23 years in the Congo. After the Simbas were defeated, many of the mercenaries remained in the country on the government payroll, assuring the control of eastern Congo. For his efforts, Tshombe was first removed as Prime Minister and then charged and convicted for treason. On 5 July 1967, Schramme, his mercenaries and supporters staged an uprising. With Schramme marching on the city of Bukavu in Kivu Province, the Congolese army fled. Schramme\u2019s goals were to have President Mobutu restore democracy, annul the treason conviction of ex-Prime Minister Tshombe and appoint Tshombe to the Cabinet. Mobutu rejected the demands. Schramme subsequently defeated the few attacks mounted against him; however, as military pressure built up against him, he realized he would eventually face defeat. In October 1967, the International Red Cross was able to negotiate an agreement with Schramme and Mobutu whereby the white mercenaries would be flown to Malta and his Congolese supporters would be flown to Zambia. At the time Schramme\u2019s forces were being pushed out of Congo and into Rwanda. The Red Cross had asked a number of countries to provide aircraft, including Great Britain, the United States and Canada - for two aircraft. With countries coming on-side, the Red Cross reduced its request of Canada to one aircraft. Throughout the early period of November, Mobutu kept changing his mind as to whether he would allow the evacuation. In the end, the Red Cross withdrew from its efforts while Mobutu talked privately with a number of countries. The evacuation did eventually take place in mid-November. On 2 November, the Department of External Affairs advised Canadian Forces Headquarters (CFHQ) that the International Red Cross had approached various countries on 31 October to arrange military transport for an estimated 900 Katangans -Schramme supporters- and between 400 and 500 women and children. Canadian Forces Headquarters issued an order on 2 November for Operation PELI PELI. Two Hercules (one each from 435 and 436 squadrons) were placed on 24-hour notice to move, as were a rifle company from the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment, ten in-flight security teams (each team with one Sergeant and 4 men), and ten medical orderlies. The expectation was that the operation could occur as early as 5 November. Late on November 7th, the R22eR company was cancelled and only one aircraft, from 436 Squadron, was tasked. One in-flight protection party and two medical assistants would also deploy. Hercules No. 10310, including two aircrews, a seven person servicing crew, the security team and the medical personnel - a total of 29 personnel- was in Ascension Island by 11 November where they awaited instructions. With the withdrawal of the Red Cross from the operation on 17 November Canadian Forces Headquarters considered the return of the Hercules, which was also recommended by the Canadian attach\u00e9 in Kinshasa.

Following the civil war in Rwanda, Hutu militias aimed at regaining power there found refuge in neighbouring countries. When in 1994, Mobutu Sese Seko, the President of Zaire, offered formal Congolese support to these militias, the Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila, Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Army and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda formed an alliance to unseat the President. The men under Kabila\u2019s command and Kagame\u2019s force were predominantly Tutsi, the Hutus main foe in Rwanda. After defeating the Mobutu-supported Hutus, the alliance turned towards Mobutu, deposing the dictator in May 1997. Kabila assumed power on 17 May and then decided to expel the forces that helped bring him into power. On 2 August 1998, Kabila attacked the Rwandan forces in eastern DRC. This threatened the Tutsis of the region as they relied upon the Rwandan military to keep hostile armed groups under control. Both Kagame and Museveni backed new rebel groups including the Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD), a Tutsi dominated guerrilla group. Kabila in turn invited Angola, Chad, Namibia and Zimbabwe to assist him. By the end of 1998, the CRD controlled one-third of the DRC. The fighting also brought other ethnic groups into conflict. International and regional pressure brought all parties to the negotiating table. On 10 July 1999, in Lusaka, Zambia, all nations involved in the conflict and most of the guerrilla groups signed the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement. A multinational force, controlled by a Joint Military Commission (JMC) and representing the signatories to the agreement, would effect the disarming of all armed groups in the DRC. The UN Security Council on 6 August authorized the deployment of up to 90 UN military liaison officers (UNMLOs) to assist in implementing the accord (Resolution 1258). The UNMLOs deployed in the six nations that were signatories to the Lusaka Agreement. Unfortunately, neither the UNMLOs nor the JMC were able to bring about a stable cease-fire. As a result, the Security Council decided that greater support was required. On 30 November 1999, Resolution 1279 authorized the Mission de l'Organisation des Nations Unies en R\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique du Congo (MONUC). [Note: some UN public statements prior to 30 November refer to the UNMLO mission as MONUC; however, the mission was only identified by the Security Council as MONUC as of 30 November.] A force of 500 unarmed UN Military Observers (UNMOs) were deployed to the DRC. Again, neither MONUC nor the JMC were able to bring stability to the DRC. Almost from the start, each side accused the other of breaking the cease-fire and violating the Lusaka Agreement. Resolution 1291 of 24 February 2000 increased MONUC to 5,537 personnel, including the 500 UNMOs. Ethnic-based fighting continued in eastern and northeastern DRC. New factions appeared and began fighting. In Ituri, the Hema and Lendu attacked each other, a problem that was to expand in 2003. There was nevertheless one bright spot. By September 2002, the Secretary-General was able to state that foreign troops had withdrawn and that the situation in the DRC had passed beyond the Lusaka Agreement. In early December 2002, the Security Council authorized an expansion of MONUC to 8,700 military personnel, followed by eight Congolese parties signing an agreement in late December to create and operate a transitional government; however, the agreement was of limited value. As the foreign troops withdrew, local warlords began to re-establish themselves throughout the DRC. Through 2002 and 2003, these warlords began attacking each other, renewing the humanitarian problem of displaced persons. In the Ituri region of northeast DRC this created a significant problem, requiring the intervention of the UN authorized Interim Emergency Multinational Force between June and the end of August 2003. Ugandan troops had increased their presence in the region after they had initially withdrawn. When they withdrew again in May 2003, a power vacuum created a situation of anarchy and violence. In the Kivu region of eastern DRC, two renegade Congolese army commanders fought government forces, with both sides committing human rights violations and atrocities. Three different ethnic groups were involved, including the Banyamulenge ethnic group (of Tutsi origin), whom the rebel commanders were claiming to protect. On 1 October 2004, the Security Council authorized an increase in MONUC\u2019s strength to 16,700, although by the end of December the actual strength was only 12,600. MONUC was now authorized under Chapter VII to inspect aircraft and transport vehicles using the airfields, border crossings, military bases and ports in North and South Kivu, and in Ituri. MONUC could use all necessary means to carry out its mandate, which included protecting civilians and collecting arms and war materiel in Ituri and Kivu found in violation of international sanctions. This has had little effect in some regions, as the Hema and Lendu militias in Ituri continued fighting but away from the MONUC presence. MONUC\u2019s presence in North Kivu did prevent an armed attack in mid-December 2004, when Pakistani MONUC forces repelled armed attackers infiltrating from Rwanda. The International Rescue Committee has estimated that 3.3 million people have died in the DRC since June 1998, while the UN estimates that 2.7 million people have become displaced or become refugees. Agreements are signed and then broken, while ethnic-based factional fighting continues to be a grave concern. The transitional government has been unable to disarm these groups and MONUC\u2019s presence and strength cannot encompass every area where violence can occur.", "Name": "CROCODILE", "Date": "26 September 1999 - Present", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canadian participation in the DRC began in September 1999. On 26 September a Canadian Forces colonel arrived in Kinshasa to assist in the creation of the headquarters for the 90 UNMLOs. The formal announcement of Canada\u2019s participation was made on 7 October, at which time it was stated that Canada could provide up to ten UNMLOs. The colonel then filled the position of Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations until replaced in early 2000. Canada continued to fill this position as MONUC expanded. A major was also in theatre working in MONUC headquarters in the position of Staff Officer Operations and Plans. In May 2000, the colonel intervened in the fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan forces in eastern DRC that had resulted in significant civilian deaths. The major also traveled often as an UNMO. Up to March 2001, they were the only two Canadians in MONUC; however, at the request of the UN the number was subsequently increased. On 15 March 2001, four of a group of eight CF officers departed for MONUC. The first four joined the two already in theatre, and filled staff positions at MONUC headquarters. The next four filled UNMO positions. The first two officers in-theatre then returned to Canada. Although the numbers vary between MONUC and regional headquarters, five Canadian officers are often based in the main headquarters in Kinshasa where they assist in the training of UMNOs and staff officers, work with demobilizing combatants, and producing MONUC information for distribution throughout the DRC.

This mandate included protecting the airport, UN and humanitarian aid personnel and the internally displaced people of Bunia.", "Mission Notes": " The conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC - formerly Zaire) began in 1994, when then President Mobutu Sese Seko supported the Rwandan Hutu militias. In opposition to Mobutu, Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila, Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Army and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda formed an alliance. After defeating the Mobutu-supported Hutus, the alliance turned against Mobutu, deposing the dictator in the spring of 1997. Kabila assumed power, but the alliance was doomed. Both Kagame and Museveni backed new rebel groups in eastern and northern DRC. After these two groups, with Rwandan and Ugandan assistance, marched on Kinshasa in 1998, Kabila invited Angola, Chad, Namibia and Zimbabwe to assist him. International pressure brought the parties to the negotiating table, all signing the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement in July 1999. To support the Lusaka Agreement, the UN Security Council authorized military liaison officers on 6 August 1999. This was followed on 30 November by the formation of the UN Observer Mission in the Congo (MONUC). A small UN security force and unarmed UN Military Observers (UNMOs) were deployed to the DRC. As part of the Lusaka Agreement, all foreign forces were required to leave the territory of the DRC, which includes the Ituri region. With its mandate limited to enforcing the Lusaka Accord, MONUC was simply not large enough to establish a large permanent presence in Ituri or to create any kind of rapid reaction force capable of deploying in the event of an emergency. Moreover, it was not authorized to intervene to prevent acts of violence committed within the DRC by Congolese groups. In late April 2003, the Ugandan forces providing de facto authority and security in Ituri began departing, with their withdrawal complete by 6 May. This was at the insistence of the Security Council, since allowing Ugandan troops to remain in the DRC could have resulted in Rwanda deploying its own troops into the region. Although MONUC had neither the mandate nor the resources, they sent the lightly-armed Uruguayan Battalion (URUBATT) to the capital of Ituri - the city of Bunia - while the government of the DRC sent 700 national police to maintain order. Despite the presence of the URUBATT, based at the airport, fighting broke out between the Lendu ethnic militia and the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC). Both attempted to control Bunia, with the result that thousands of people fled or collected around MONUC sites, including the URUBATT. Although atrocities were committed in Ituri, the presence of the URUBATT saved thousands of lives, as the battalion protected the airport and town when attacked. The Congolese police disappeared at the first sign of the threat. Given a situation that was threatening to spiral out of control, the UN Secretary-General called upon France to lead a UN-authorized force to restore order. On 30 May 2003, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1484 creating the Interim Emergency Multinational Force (IEMF). The IEMF was authorized until 1 September 2003, requiring a follow-on force to maintain the security that the IEMF was hoped to achieve. The Security Council thus authorized an increase in the size of MONUC, and the deployment of a brigade of 4800 personnel to Ituri when the IEMF (maximum strength of 1400) left. The first IEMF personnel arrived in Bunia on 6 June. They were supported by French Air Force aircraft to conduct reconnaissance and close air support. France and Sweden also deployed over 220 special forces personnel to give the IEMF capability to attack threats outside the Bunia area. One of the IEMF\u2019s first actions was to declare the town of Bunia and a 10-km area around it a \u201cweapons invisible\u201d zone, meaning that weapons could not be openly carried. But no effort was made at disarming the militias, with the result that they continued to fight amongst themselves. The IEMF ground troops nevertheless did become involved in skirmishes with the Lendu and UPC militias, which demonstrated their resolve. IEMF patrols also cut the supply lines of the militias, which helped reduce the power of the rival groups. In time displaced persons returned to the safety of the town, economic activity began, humanitarian aid became available again, and some semblance of normality returned by the end of the IEMF mandate. The IEMF handed over responsibility for the Ituri region to MONUC on 1 September. The last IEMF forces departed on 7 September. Canadian participation in the IEMF was quickly organized. By 23 May, a warning order had been issued about the possible deployment and designated Operation CARAVAN, the mission was formally announced on 30 May. Two CC-130 Hercules deployed on Operation APOLLO would be detached, operating out of Entebbe, Uganda for a one-month period. The Canadian contingent would be 51 persons, most from Op Apollo, but some deploying from Canada. In one month of operations, from 8 June to 7 July, Task Force Entebbe/Bunia personnel completed 50 flights, flying 545 persons and 490,000 kgs of freight into Bunia. The only problem was a bullet that hit one of the aircraft on 17 June, but which did not penetrate the fuselage.

Ugandan troops had increased their presence in the region after they had initially withdrawn. When they withdrew again in May 2003, a power vacuum created a situation of anarchy and violence. In the Kivu region of eastern DRC, two renegade Congolese army commanders fought government forces, with both sides committing human rights violations and atrocities. Three different ethnic groups were involved, including the Banyamulenge ethnic group (of Tutsi origin), whom the rebel commanders were claiming to protect.\u00a0\n\nOn 1 October 2004, the Security Council authorized an increase in MONUC\u2019s strength to 16,700, although by the end of December the actual strength was only 12,600. MONUC was now authorized under Chapter VII to inspect aircraft and transport vehicles using the airfields, border crossings, military bases and ports in North and South Kivu, and in Ituri. MONUC could use all necessary means to carry out its mandate, which included protecting civilians and collecting arms and war materiel in Ituri and Kivu found in violation of international sanctions.\u00a0\n\nThis has had little effect in some regions as the Hema and Lendu militias in Ituri in December 2004 and January 2005 continued fighting but away from the MONUC presence. MONUC\u2019s presence in North Kivu did prevent an armed attack in mid-December 2004, when Paklistani MONUC forces repelled armed attackers infiltrating from Rwanda.\u00a0\n\nThe International Rescue Committee has estimated that 3.3 million people have died in the DRC since June 1998, while the UN estimates that 2.7 million people have become displaced or become refugees. Agreements are signed and then broken, while ethnic-based factional fighting continues to be a grave concern. The transitional government has been unable to disarm these groups and MONUC\u2019s presence and strength cannot encompass every area where violence can occur.\u00a0\n\nCanadian participation in the DRC began in September 1999. On 26 September a Canadian Forces colonel arrived in Kinshasa to assist in the creation of the headquarters for the 90 UNMLOs. The formal announcement of Canada\u2019s participation was made on 7 October, at which time it was stated that Canada could provide up to ten UNMLOs. The colonel then filled the position of Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations until replaced in early 2000.\u00a0\n\nCanada continued to fill this position as MONUC expanded. A major was also in theatre working in MONUC headquarters in the position of Staff Officer Operations and Plans. This did not mean that either officer was stuck in this office. In May 2000, the colonel intervened in the fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan forces in eastern DRC that had resulted in significant civilian deaths. The major also traveled often as an UNMO. Up to March 2001, they were the only two Canadians in MONUC; however, at the request of the UN the number was subsequently increased.\u00a0\n\nOn 15 March 2001, four of a group of eight CF officers departed for MONUC. The first four joined the two already in theatre, and filled staff positions at MONUC headquarters.\u00a0\n\nTask Force Democratic Republic of the Congo (TF DRC) is the Canadian contingent in MONUSCO. Its nine members include staff officers with expertise in fields such as law, information operations and training, and a senior non-commissioned member who handles all national support tasks. The staff officers are divided between MONUSCO Headquarters in Kinshasa and its eastern sector headquarters in Goma.\n\nOn 31 December 2010, MONUSCO had troops from 52 nations and police from 25 nations. At that time, mission strength stood at:\n Future reconfigurations of MONUSCO will be determined as the situation evolved on the ground, including: the completion of ongoing military operations in North and South Kivu as well as Orientale provinces; improved government capacity to protect the population effectively; and the consolidation of State authority throughout the territory. \u00a0"}}, {"opName": "FIREFLY", "countryRegion": "Eritria", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1993-09-07", "endDate": "1993-10-21", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/firefly.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation FIREFLY", "International Mission Name": "Operation FIREFLY", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Eritria", "Mission Date": "7 September 1993 - 21 October 1993", "Mission Mandate": " Return former Royal Canadian Navy Fairey Firefly aircraft to Canada.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " The Royal Canadian Navy operated 66 Fairey Firefly fighter-bomber aircraft between June 1946 and 1951.

In July 1991 the CF sent a Hercules with a recce team to Ethiopia to see if the CF could contribute in this potential humanitarian disaster. Approval for assistance to the UN\u2019s World Food Programme was given on 2 August under the name Operation PRESERVE. Op Preserve would consist of a team of 60 personnel - aircrew, groundcrew, signalers and air movements personnel - and three CF Hercules, operating out of Djibouti on the Horn of Africa.

Two aircraft would be operational at any one time, the third being rotated for maintenance. The flights would start in Djibouti, leaving about 5:00 AM. They went to four different airfields throughout Ethiopia (Dire Dawa , Gode, Kabridar and Makale), with a total of six to eight flights being conducted daily to mainly gravel fields. Such wear and tear increased the burden on maintenance staff, while the lack of automated equipment meant that cargo normally 360 to 400 sacks of grain each weighing about 50 kilograms - had to be unloaded by hand. Weekly support flights arrived from Lahr. Besides mail, supplies and parts for the Hercs, the flights also brought replacement personnel. Due to the high flying rate during the initial period, the initial contingent was rotated out at the start of September 1991. Thereafter the rotations were on a monthly basis. Scheduled to last until 12 November, the deployment was later extended to 12 December when in mid-October, the Canadian Embassy in Addis Ababa identified the need for another month of airlift. This was approved by 29 October. The last flights for Op Preserve were conducted on 11 December.

The descendants of these freemen form about 5 percent of the country\u2019s population, which includes at least 16 indigenous ethnic groups, but it was the Americo-Liberians who maintained power until 1980, when Master Sergeant Samuel Doe staged a bloody coup. This began a period of violence that lasted until 2003 and saw more than 200,000 civilians killed, more than 900,000 seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, children forced to serve as soldiers, and ever-increasing levels of human rights abuses, corruption and ethnic tension. One coup attempt against Doe failed in November 1985. Another led by Charles Taylor from the territory of the Ivory Coast, began in 1989 and precipitated a seven-year-long civil war which itself served as an impetus for entirely new guerrilla groups to form. A cease-fire was finally arranged in August 1996, but fighting erupted again in August 1999 when the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) spearheaded attacks against the government. In June 2003, with assistance from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) a truce appeared to be holding. After considerable international pressure, Charles Taylor finally stepped down. West African mediators called for a UN-led peacekeeping mission. The Security Council authorized the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) on 19 September 2003. UNMIL was not the first UN mission in Liberia. In 1993, the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) was tasked to support the ECOWAS Military Observer group (ECOMOG) in implementing the 1993 Cotonou Peace Agreement, which took until 1996 to implement. At the time that UNMIL was created there were 3500 ECOWAS Mission in Liberia (ECOMIL) troops in Liberia. Composed of soldiers from eight West African countries, ECOMIL was not prepared to run a UN mission of 15,000 troops. The Stand-by High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG) was requested to provide a headquarters component for UNMIL during the transition from ECOMIL to UNMIL. The SHIRBRIG personnel would augment the UN Interim Headquarters until the main UN force headquarters arrived, which was tentatively scheduled for 1 November 2003. SHIRBRIG would then leave Liberia around 6 November. (SHIRBRIG is composed of nine full participant European nations and Canada. Five other European nations are also participants, while five other nations, including one each from Africa, Asia and South American are observers.) SHIRBRIG was scheduled to provide 35 personnel across the spectrum of headquarters responsibilities. The personnel rendezvoused in Copenhagen before deploying to Monrovia, the Liberian capital, on 23 September. They then began transferring responsibility from ECOMIL to the UN, with the UN taking full responsibility for peacekeeping on 1 October. Despite the peace agreement, tension in Monrovia remained high and fighting broke out on 1 October, when the UN was blamed for allowing LURD leader Sekou Conneh into the city, an event that sparked rock throwing and then escalated. The fighting stopped within a day. Disagreements between LURD and the Liberian interim leader, Gyude Bryant, also resulted in interference with UN humanitarian operations, a clear hint that events could become violent.

Dr. Brooks left Canada on 21 December, but due to reasons beyond the team\u2019s control, they only arrived in Morocco in early January 1960. The time was not wasted as Dr. Gingras used the period to brief the team on what was expected. Once in Morocco, the international effort was split into two teams, one in Meknes and one in Sidi Kacem, with the latter team led by Dr. Brooks. The team of physicians were able to determine that the cause of the paralysis was aircraft lubricant that had been introduced into the domestic food market, cut with olive oil and sold as a cooking oil. Over 10,000 people were stricken. After 18 months of effort in rehabilitation and surgery, only 120 were left stricken. Dr. Brooks left Morocco about 2 April 1960."}}, {"opName": "(Morocco 1960)", "countryRegion": "Morocco", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1960-03-05", "endDate": "1960-03-07", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/morocco-1960.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Morocco 1960", "International Mission Name": "Morocco 1960", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Morocco", "Mission/Operation Notes": " On the night of 29 February 1960, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the city of Agadir, situated on the Atlantic Coast of Morocco.

The mandate of ONUMOZ was: ONUMOZ's mandate formally came to an end at midnight on 9 December 1994. The Mission was terminated at the end on 31 January 1995. Mozambique had been a Portuguese colony since 1752. Beginning in 1962 the Frente de Liberatacao de Mocambique (FRELIMO - Mozambique Liberation Front) was formed in Tanzania by exiled leader Eduardo Mondlane, with initial backing coming from both western and communist countries. In 1964, FRELIMO staged its first guerrilla attacks in northern Mozambique, and by the mid-1960\u2019s Portugal was forced to maintain over 70,000 troops to maintain its hold on the colony. Events in Portugal would bring an end to this when, following the \u201cCarnation Revolution\u201d of 25 April 1974, a new government in Lisbon declared its intention to grant Mozambique its independence.\u00a0\n\nOnce Mozambique was independent, FRELIMO set about assisting other African independence movements with their struggles. The Zimbabwe African National Union, led by Robert Mugabe, used Mozambique as a staging area for its attacks against the white-led government in Rhodesia and received direct Mozambique-government support. Soviet, East German and Cuban military advisors also arrived to assist Mozambique and the guerrilla groups it supported.\u00a0\n\nIn 1976 Rhodesia assisted the formation of the Resistencia Nacional Mocambique (RENAMO - Mozambique National Resistance) to overthrow the government of Mozambique and prevent it from supporting guerrilla organizations. RENAMO guerrillas were soon destroying the already poor economy of Mozambique and its infrastructure, attacking rail and power lines, roads and bridges and oil storage depots. More alarmingly, RENAMO began a systematic campaign of terrorizing civilians.\u00a0\n\nWith the change to a government based on majority rule in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), RENAMO lost its initial supporter; however, South Africa quickly filled the void. FRELIMO, in attempting to counter RENAMO\u2019s tactics, also began using terror and intimidation against its own people, and it invited troops from Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe to keep the railway open between Beira, on the coast of Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.\u00a0\n\nBetween RENAMO\u2019s attacks, natural disasters such as drought and flood, and the government\u2019s inability to generate a viable economy, Mozambique rapidly became the poorest country in the world. Over 1 million people were killed and over 1.1 million became refugees in this deadly civil war.\u00a0\n\nInternational pressure brought FRELIMO and RENAMO to the negotiating table and on 4 October 1992 a General Peace agreement was signed in Rome by Joaquim Alberto Chissano for Mozambique and Afonso Dhlakama for RENAMO. The agreement created a framework for establishing peace in Mozambique and requested UN assistance in implementing the agreement, providing technical assistance for elections and monitoring then.\u00a0\n\nThe Security Council adopted resolution 782 on 13 October 1992. It authorized an interim force with 25 military observers. Twenty-one observers, drawn mostly from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization, arrived in Mozambique on the 15th, the day the agreement entered into force. Two teams of observers were deployed to the provincial capitals of Beira and Nampula and, later, two other posts where they verified the withdrawal of foreign troops from Mozambique.\u00a0\n\nHowever, to observe the implementation of the agreement, the UN required more than 25 observers. The two sides were to disengage and concentrate in assembly areas, and those soldiers who would not become part of the new Mozambican Defence Force had to be demobilized no later than six months after the agreement came into force. The UN was also committed to supervise a general election and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. On 3 December 1992 the Secretary-General presented a plan to the Security Council for the creation of ONUMOZ. It was approved on 16 December by Resolution 797.\u00a0\n\nMilitarily, ONUMOZ consisted of over 6,300 armed personnel, including five infantry battalions, to provide security throughout the country, especially against armed bandits whose numbers increased as the former guerrilla forces assembled for demobilization. There were also 354 unarmed UNMOs to verify the cease-fire, disarm the two sides, and demobilize them before their reintegration into society. The UNMOs would also assist in the delivery of food to the assembly areas for demobilizing forces and assist in the delivery of humanitarian aid throughout the country.\u00a0\n\nAlthough UN troops arrived slowly and the government and Renamo disagreed on where to locate the 49 sites -- it would take a year before all of them were operating -- the cease-fire held. foreign troops left as the formed \"UN\" Infantry battalions began to arrive, and once roads were reopened humanitarian assistance began to be provided on a large scale. Land mines left over from the civil war remained a problem, however, and mine-clearing training was therefore added to the mission\u2019s responsibilities.\u00a0\n\nThe election in Mozambique was held on 27 and 28 October 1994 despite incidents of banditry. Voter turn-out was high, and given the cooperation of all parties, the election was declared free and fair. President Chissano, the FRELIMO candidate, won, and RENAMO leader Dhlakama accepted the results.\u00a0\n\nAlthough the elections were to terminate ONUMOZ\u2019s mandate, it was extended for six weeks, as there were still soldiers and guerrillas to be demobilized and the new government to be installed. Once both had been completed, ONUMOZ formally ended on 9 December 1994. Personnel remained in theatre until the end of January 1995 while the mission wound down.", "Name": "CONSONANCE", "Date": "14 February 1993 - 13 January 1995", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canadian planning for ONUMOZ began in October 1992. From the outset it was recognized that the contribution would be military observers and not formed units, as the Canadian Forces were already heavily deployed on other operations. As a result Canada agreed to provide fifteen UNMOs. The warning order was issued on 24 December, without identifying individual participants. Eventually five UNMOs with the Organization des Nations Unies en El Salvador (ONUSAL) and nine with the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II (UNAVEM II) became available as ONUSAL was downsizing and UNAVEM II was failing due to the resumption of civil war. All fourteen Canadian officers were in theatre by 14 February 1993, under the Canadian name Operation CONSONANCE. They would each finish the one- year tours they had started in other operations. All were employed in the ONUMOZ headquarters, the three regional headquarters and at assembly areas. Their main task was to count and then demobilize both guerrilla and government soldiers, and to move weapons taken from these individuals to regional arms depots for safe storage. Once demobilized, the ex-fighters would be sent to training centres.\u00a0\n\nThe next rotation totaled 15 personnel. As with the first contingent, they were deployed throughout the country and in all headquarters. One officer, however, was seconded to the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR) from August to October 1993. Here he was part of the advance party that set up the mission and provided valuable service to Brigadier-General Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, the Chief Military Officer for UNOMUR.\u00a0\n\nBy June 1994, ONUMOZ began planning for downsizing. The UN indicated that only 4 Canadians would be required after November 1994. As a result, the size of the Canadian contingent was reduced in the coming months. Thirteen had returned to Canada by mid-August, with two remaining and another two officers arriving from Canada. These four returned to Canada in December 1994 and January 1995, after the UN mandate expired, with the last leaving on 13 January.\u00a0\n\nA total of 34 Canadian Forces officers served in ONUMOZ.\n"}}, {"opName": "MODULE", "countryRegion": "Mozambique", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1994-05-01", "endDate": "2019-02-23", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/module.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Accelerated De-mining Program: Mozambique", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Accelerated De-mining Program: Mozambique (UNADP)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Mozambique", "Mission Date": "1 May 1994 - Present", "Mission Mandate": " The government of Mozambique and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) created the United Nations Accelerated Demining Program (UNADP). The mandate of the UNADP is to develop an indigenous mine clearance capability in Mozambique. From 1976 to 1992 Mozambique was embroiled in a bitter civil war. On 4 October 1992, the Mozambique government and the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) signed a General Peace Agreement. This was followed in early 1993 by a United Nations deployment of peacekeepers and civilians whose tasks included supervision of the peace agreement, demobilizing soldiers and guerrillas, and providing humanitarian assistance. The United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) also initiated the first demining program for Mozambique. RENAMO and the government are estimated to have laid about 1 million mines during the civil war. Few maps were kept of where these mines were laid. An estimated 562 square kilometres of the country are affected by mines and unexploded ordnance. Initial mine clearance by ONUMOZ was designed to clear major roads and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid and the return of refugees and internally displaced persons. ONUMOZ also created a programme to train demining technicians and supervisors. In May 1994 the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Assistance Coordination (UNOHAC), created by the UN Security Council as the humanitarian component of ONUMOZ, took over this task, hoping to train 450 Mozambicans by the end of 1994. When ONUMOZ was terminated on 31 January 1995, the Mozambique government, working with the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs, created an Accelerated Demining Program (UNADP). The program had a staff of about 500 Mozambicans. In 1995, the Mozambique government created the National Demining Commission to coordinate landmine-related activities. In 1999, the name was changed to the National Demining Institute (IND). Despite the demining activities, mines remain a serious problem in Mozambique. The United States State Department reported that between 1992 and 1998 landmines created 10,000 victims in the country. In 1987, 43 percent were women and children who had encountered mines while getting water, planting fields and herding animals. The rate of deaths dropped to 25 per year in 2000; however, the floods of February/March 2000 and February/March 2001 shifted landmines, some as far as 20 km from their original locations. Fishermen were catching mines in their nets. In 1999, the Director of the IND indicated that a survey had identified 791 mined areas and another 1374 suspected areas. These are integrated into a National Mine Action Plan, which itself is a part of the National Mine Action Strategy. The UN ADP is not, however, part of the national program. International support for the UNADP has involved both military and non-governmental organizations. Militarily, Australia, Canada and New Zealand have sent engineers to Mozambique. New Zealand contributes two military engineers to the UNADP, one as Chief Technical Advisor and one as Training Technical Advisor. Australia withdrew its last two soldiers in early 2002 after an eight-year contribution to the UNADP. The UNADP had 10 platoons totaling 450 deminers, 15 supervisors, four survey teams, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team, and demining instructors. The emphasis of the UNADP is on training a fully-developed local mine clearing capability. Since 1992, over 54,000 mines have been removed from 10,570 hectares of land, 7718 kms of road and 1824 kms of power lines.", "Name": "MODULE", "Date": "12 March 1999 - 15 May 2000", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada has been an active participant in the demining effort in Mozambique. The Canadian International Demining Centre, with support from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), conducted a survey, the results of which were released in June 2001. A further survey was conducted due to the floods of 2001. CIDA has also been supporting an integrated mine action project of the Canadian Auto Workers and Co-operation Canada Mozambique. CIDA and the CAW have each provided $1.25 million over three years. The Canadian Forces have also participated in CIDA\u2019s efforts. In early 1998, at the request of the UNDP, CIDA asked the CF to provide three personnel to the UN ADP for a one-year period. After a reconnaissance was conducted to determine what manner of activity was expected, the Minister of National Defence approved the request in late October 1998. On 18 March 1999, the tasking order for Operation MODULE was promulgated. One engineer captain, one field engineer warrant officer and one geomatics technician warrant officer were tasked on a one-year posting, under the name Task Force Mozambique. The captain arrived in Mozambique on 11 April while the warrant officers arrived several weeks later. Once in Mozambique, all three taught courses related to demining and the associated use of computer technology, as well as producing Standing Operating Procedures. The warrant officers also conducted surveys with members of the UN ADP as part of on-the-job training. The captain also visited the mine action centres in Croatia and Kosovo to exchange information and brief these centres on CF activities in Mozambique. After the heavy rains of February and March 2000, the members of Op Module provided information to Canada on the situation in Mozambique, which greatly assisted in the delivery of Canadian humanitarian aid in early March.

Thousands more were left homeless in Gaza province, in the middle of the country. To make matters worse, as the storm moved west, it brought Botswana 75 percent of its normal rainfall in three days. Most of Botswana drains eastward, through Mozambique, raising the water levels there even more. The Limpopo River burst its banks. The lack of fresh water generated dysentery outbreaks in parts of Mozambique. The United Nations recognized that there was a potential crisis. While the rains eased off and appeared to bring some respite, worse was to come. On 22 February, Cyclone Elise hit Mozambique near the centre of the country, just north of the area already hit by flooding. Over the next week, the heavy rainfall from the cyclone created massive flooding in most of the country, with the water having risen four to eight metres in some areas. Aid agencies estimated that over 100,000 people needed to be evacuated, while many more were in urgent need of aid. But the rain kept falling, and did not stop until mid-March.

UNTAG was also to help the Special Representative to ensure that: all hostile acts were ended; troops were confined to base, and, in the case of the South Africans, ultimately withdrawn from Namibia; all discriminatory laws were repealed, political prisoners were released, Namibian refugees were permitted to return, intimidation of any kind was prevented, and law and order were impartially maintained.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " After the First World War, the German colony of South-West Africa, which had been captured by the then Union of South Africa, became a mandate of the League of Nations, the mandate authority being delegated to South Africa. After the Second World War, South Africa made repeated requests of the United Nations to be allowed to annex the territory. At the same time, South Africa refused to place the territory under United Nations Trusteeship. South Africa agreed in 1975 to work towards granting Namibia independence, an agreement being reached on 10 April 1978; however, it took a further ten years (16 February 1989) before a means was found to implement the agreement. To a large degree, it was the actions of the South West Africa People\u2019s Organization (SWAPO) and their guerrilla campaign that forced South Africa\u2019s hand. The UN had recognized SWAPO as the legitimate voice of the people of Namibia. At the height of the conflict, South Africa had deployed over 30,000 troops into Namibia. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) had been proposed in the 1978 agreement. When finally implemented in February 1989 it was assumed that UNTAG could be in place by 1 April, but delays in obtaining Security Council approval and firm financing pushed that date back, so that only 291 observers were in place by that date. The first infantry battalion began to arrive two weeks later, and it was not until 1 May that the entire force of 4,493 was deployed. (Besides the 300 observers, the major components were three infantry battalions, two logistics units, and engineer, signals, and medical units, as well as a medium helicopter and medium air transport unit.) UNTAG was fundamentally a political mission aimed at producing conditions that would allow for free and fair elections in Namibia. It had three separate components, drawn from twenty-two countries. The 1500-strong civilian component\u2019s main tasks were to oversee the return of refugees and to prepare for the elections. The role of the police component, which included one hundred members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was to ensure that the South West Africa Police, an organization with a heavy South African influence, fulfilled their duties in an efficient, professional and non-partisan manner. The military force\u2019s role was to monitor the cease-fire and the withdrawal of South African forces, confine SWAPO military forces to bases, and maintain some degree of surveillance of Namibia\u2019s borders. As SWAPO\u2019s bases were outside Namibia, mainly in Angola, UNTAG personnel were also required to operate in that country. There had already been violations of the cease-fire when the UNTAG infantry battalion arrived, as SWAPO personnel had crossed the border overnight to engage South African military force and the South West Africa Police. Lacking both vehicles and communications equipment, the UNTAG observers who were first in the area could do very little to monitor these events, but once the full military contingent was in place there was relatively good progress. South Africa worked hard to meet the schedule: the South West African Territorial force was demobilised by 27 May, while its military force achieved their mandated withdrawal by 24 June.", "Name": "MATADOR", "Date": "14 March 1989 - 21 March 1990", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada\u2019s participation in UNTAG dated back to the five-nation contact group that attempted to mediate a South African withdrawal from South West Africa throughout the 1980s. Once negotiations bore fruit, however, the Canadian military contribution, designated Operation MIRADOR, was assembled very quickly. Following official notification from the UN on 10 February 1989, the advance party was in place in Namibia on 14 March, while the main contingent would follow in April. It comprised several new units specific to the tasking. Three were created on 11 April 1989: a Canadian Contingent United Nations Transition Group (CCUNTAG) was formed as the headquarters, supported by the Canadian Element UNTAG, and 89 Canadian Logistics Unit (89 CLU). A fourth unit, 89 Canadian Air Transport Unit (89 CATU) was formed on 24 May 1989 to meet the UN\u2019s requirement for medium airlift. The main Op MATADOR contingent began to gather at CFB Petawawa on 20 March. Although 89 CLU would be formed primarily from 2 Service Battalion, support personnel came from across Canada and the unit would include nineteen reservists. Sixteen of the 253-strong contingent would serve for one year; the rest would have six month rotations. They and their lighter equipment were airlifted to Namibia by 436 and 437 Squadrons between 12 April and 7 May; heavier equipment (80 sea containers, 47 vehicles, and 600 tonnes of other cargo) was shipped on two merchant vessels, arriving at Walvis Bay on 4 May, whence it was transferred by rail to Windhoek. With its main base in Windhoek, the capital, and a detachment at Ketmanshoop (500 km to the south), 89 CLU supported all military, police, and civilian UNTAG personnel in the southern half of Namibia. Co-operating with the Poles, 89 CLU established a major warehousing system and then ensured timely delivery of supplies to a far-flung network of units and locations. It also provided first- and second-line maintenance for the mission\u2019s vehicles. Ten military police served with the UN\u2019s 71-strong MP contingent, which operated throughout the territory, while individual Canadians filled staff positions at UNTAG HQ, including the chief liaison officer between UNTAG and the South African Defence Force. 89 CATU, formed from 429 Squadron, provided two CC-130 Hercules aircraft to transport personnel and supplies to northern Namibia and Angola. Supported by the Polish logistics company and a ten-person MP detachment (four were Canadian), 89 CATU operated from Grootfontein, 500 km north of Windhoek, in May and June 1989, when it was replaced by a Spanish detachment. September 1989 saw the first rotation of Canadian personnel, with a contingent based on 1 Service Battalion (Calgary) replacing that provided by 2 Service Battalion. They would remain until mid-January 1990, when UNTAG began to draw down. The last of the 600 Canadians to serve on Operation MATADOR departed when the UN mission itself closed on 21 March 1990. It had been a success: free and fair elections, with heavy turnout and no reports of violence, were held between 7 and 11 November and the transfer of power that followed proceeded smoothly."}}, {"opName": "(Nigeria 1968)", "countryRegion": "Nigeria", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1968-08-02", "endDate": "1968-08-09", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/nigeria-1968.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Nigeria 1968", "International Mission Name": "Nigeria 1968", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Nigeria", "Mission Date": "2 August 1968 - 9 August 1968", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " To transport food aid into and throughout Nigeria on behalf of the International Commission of the Red Cross.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " In July 1967, a secessionist movement in eastern Nigeria (Biafra) declared its independence.

From the outset, Biafran authorities alleged that the Nigerian military was guilty of serious human rights abuses and perhaps even genocide. Images of starving Biafran children produced an international outcry, and as a result of these protests the Nigerian government invited Britain, Canada, Poland, Sweden, the United Nations, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to despatch observers to ascertain and report on the validity of Biafran allegations. All agreed, with Canada choosing to send one observer provided he had complete freedom of movement and to report everything he saw. The observer groups comprised representatives from all participants, but while the UN and OAU members submitted individual reports, the British, Canadian, Polish, and Swedish observers tried to achieve consensus in their reporting; minority reports were nevertheless acceptable when they could not. Despite widespread suspicions that their work would be obstructed, the observer groups by and large were free to travel where they needed to, and although they reported evidence of \u201cunprovoked and inexcusable killings\u201d - not uncommon in such conflicts -- there was no evidence that the Nigerian forces had been or were engaged in genocide.

The Nigerian Federal Military Government (FMG) quickly moved to bring the secessionist state back under Nigerian control. As a result, the nascent Biafran government found itself isolated and cut off from all food and basic necessities. A relief flight was authorized and took place in early August 1968, but no further activity was forthcoming. At this point, no agreement had been reached between the three parties as to the use of airfields and permission to fly into specific areas. Despite the lack of agreement Norway, Sweden, Denmark Finland and Switzerland made aircraft and crews available to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in mid August and that organization actually undertook some relief flights before it had local approval to do so.\u00a0\n\nThe ICRC continued its pressure on Canada to provide aircraft. Public pressure was also mounting for Canada to provide some assistance. On 2 September, the FMG agreed to allow the use of the Uli airstrip in Biafra in daylight hours for ten days. The FMG would ensure that the ICRC flights would not be attacked by FMG forces.\u00a0\n\nSecuring FMG and Biafran approval had been a major success. Biafra relied upon the airfields in the territory it controlled in order to bring in military equipment and munitions and would therefore not allow some airfields to be used for humanitarian purposes. On the other hand, the FMG knew that arms smugglers had exploited relief flights to cover their activities, especially at night. That was the reason why it limited the Uli flights to the hours of daylight.\u00a0\n\nThe Canadian Government approved giving support to the ICRC on 10 October, 1968 by means of an \u201cAir Support Detachment, Canadian Armed Forces - Nigeria\u201d. Given the atmosphere of mistrust that had grown up as the ICRC tried to persuade the FMG to co-operate, as well as the continuing violence of an on-going civil war, Ottawa agreed that Nigeria should be treated as a war zone for pension purposes.\u00a0\n\nUnder operation BLUENOSE the first CC-130 Hercules left Canada on 12 October, arriving in Lagos on the 14th. This Hercules from 436 Squadron had two crews, support personnel and equipment to conduct shuttle flights within Nigeria. It was followed on 14 October by a second Hercules, from 435 Squadron. (This flight was Phase II, or Bluenose Phase II, and has therefore been mistakenly identified as Operation Bluenose II in some literature.) It was to operate from Santa Isabel, Equatorial Guinea; however, as the ICRC had not yet arranged landing rights in Santa Isabel, the aircraft and crew had to wait 11 days at Ascension Island until the proper clearances were received. A third Hercules, also from 435 Squadron, departed on 15 October with support personnel, equipment and the tent city in which the aircrew would be sleeping while in Santa Isabel. They waited at Recife for clearances to be received.\u00a0\n\nAs things turned out, the 436 Squadron mission was still-born as the ICRC was never able to obtain approval for shuttle flights within Nigeria. Both 436 crews (the first 436 Hercules had to return to Canada in early November because of serviceability problems) therefore spent almost all their time in Lagos, the Nigerian capital, waiting for clearances to arrive. With nothing in the offing, the second 436 Squadron Hercules was ordered home, departing on 11 November.\u00a0\n\nThe situation at Santa Isabel was somewhat better. The first Hercules arrived on 27 October, followed by the support-carrying aircraft the next day. The intent was for the first of the Hercules to commence flying relief missions into Uli on the night of 28/29 October, despite concerns on the part of the Department of National Defence that Canada could be perceived as conducting clandestine operations, i.e. flying in arms under the guise of relief flights.\u00a0\n\nThe mission for the 28/29th was scrubbed when it was learned that an FMG aircraft had attacked the airfield at Uli on the night of 26/27th. The Commanding Officer of the detachment conducted a reconnaissance flight to Uli in another Red Cross aircraft on the night of 29/30th. Assurances were sought from the FMG that they would not attack the CF aircraft, while the Biafrans insisted that flights arrive at night, as aircraft on the airfield during the day would likely be attacked by the FMG. Despite the potential threats, permission was granted to commence operations on the night of 30/31 October.\u00a0\n\nOver the next six nights, 11 flights were conducted into Uli, carrying over 395,000 lbs of dried fish, powdered milk and oatmeal, as well as six jeeps for the use of the ICRC. The 12th flight was cancelled while enroute to Uli, on orders from Air Transport Command Headquarters (ATCHQ). While ATCHQ had initially given the green light to conduct operations into Uli, this decision was reconsidered in light of the potential for embarrassment for Canada. The FMG had withdrawn their permission for night flights into Uli, and the Commander Air Transport Command was concerned about the perception of Canada\u2019s neutrality, given that it was Biafran soldiers offloading the aircraft.\u00a0\n\nThe aircraft at Santa Isabel was subsequently grounded. The FMG did not reinstate its permission for night flights into Uli, Biafra would not allow day-time flights, and Air Transport Command was not prepared to flaunt another nation\u2019s sovereignty. The personnel at Santa Isabel returned to Canada on 15 November, replaced by another team. The replacement personnel undertook two operational flights. The first was to transfer some refugees from Santa Isabel to Dahomey on 19 November. The second was on 20 November when the Hercules departed for Geneva, Switzerland, to pick up relief supplies from Europe. With no authority to conduct relief flights, the personnel at Santa Isabel were ordered home, leaving on 15 December.\u00a0\n\nDespite the absence of Canadian aircraft in support of ICRC relief flights, the issue was not closed. In a report on the proceedings at Santa Isabel, the Detachment Commander had recommended air drops as a means of delivering supplies. His idea was given serious consideration within the Canadian Forces, but it was eventually dropped due to a lack of support from the FMG, Biafra and the ICRC.\u00a0\n\nSuch was the state of deprivation in Biafra, however, that the Canadian cabinet approved aid drops in December 1969 should all interested parties agree, but neither the FMG nor the ICRC gave their assent. With the civil war still raging, in July 1969 Canada put forward a proposal to provide inspectors who would verify to the Nigerian authorities that relief flights were not carrying arms - and so perhaps facilitate the resumption of these missions."}}, {"opName": "(Nigeria 1969)", "countryRegion": "Nigeria", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1969-11-01", "endDate": "1969-11-15", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/nigeria-1969.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Nigeria 1969", "International Mission Name": "Nigeria 1969", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Nigeria", "Mission Date": "1 November 1969 - 15 November 1969", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " To provide a ship that could be used as a neutral location for peace talks between the Government of Nigeria and the secessionist leaders.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " By October 1969 the civil war in Nigeria had been ongoing for two years.

At the United Nations, the Canadian representative was approached about Canada providing a ship on which the negotiations could be held. General Gowan of the Nigerian government had not rejected the idea and General Ojukwu of the Biafran government had given his informal agreement. The concept was that separate helicopters would pick up the leaders daily and fly them to a ship that would serve as a neutral setting, remaining outside Nigerian territorial waters. On 27 October, a message to this effect was sent from New York to External Affairs in Ottawa. This was the brought to the attention of the Chief of the Defence Staff who agreed to the proposal. The Minister of National Defence approved the concept on 10 November. The ship would be either HMCS Provider, Protector or Cape Scott, or possibly two or more destroyers. At least three helicopters would also be needed. Although the plan was approved, it is unknown what further steps were taken in planning for this mission.

By the 1960s, Britain was granting independence to most of its colonies in Africa, using the principle of majority rule. This was unacceptable to the minority white government of Ian Smith, Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, as it was known by then. On 11 November 1965, he proclaimed a unilateral declaration of independence. Britain and the international community refused to accept this declaration, with the United Nations instituting sanctions against the country. With no prospect of majority rule, two nationalist organizations were formed and began to conduct guerrilla campaigns against the Rhodesian government: the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), led by Robert Mugabe and operating from Mozambique, and the Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union (ZAPU), led by Joshua Nkomo and operating from Zambia. The two groups were based on tribal lines, with the Mashona being represented by Mugabe and the Matabele by Nkomo. From 1965 to 1979, a war raged that was overshadowed by the Vietnam War, thereby keeping the bloody and brutal conflict from the international spotlight. Under pressure, Smith negotiated an internal settlement with three black leaders within Rhodesia in March 1978. A white-only referendum in 1979 approved a new constitution and a name change to Rhodesia-Zimbabwe. In the subsequent April 1979 elections, Bishop Abel Muzorewa was elected in a poll that included 63 percent of eligible voters. Despite the fact that the voting had been declared fair by British observers, Mugabe and Nkomo were not happy and they put pressure on the presidents of Mozambique and Zambia to have new elections that included both the ZANU and ZAPU. Bishop Muzorewa was eventually persuaded to allow new elections, a result of the Lancaster House Agreement and negotiations that came to fruition on 23 December 1979. As part of the elections agreement, both ZANU and ZAPU agreed to a cease-fire that became effective on 28 December 1979 and to send their troops to assembly points for the election. A Commonwealth Cease-fire Monitoring Force supplied by Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Kenya was created to observe the assembly of (and count) the insurgents. A Commonwealth Observer Group from eleven countries (including Canada) was also created to monitor the elections. Supporting them, and actually observing the activities at the polls and in the various administrative regions of Rhodesia before the election were over 100 official and unofficial observers and support staff, including English police officers. Mugabe won the election.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canadian participation in the Commonwealth Election Commission Observer Group began with a request from the United Kingdom. A reconnaissance team travelled to Rhodesia-Zimbabwe in January 1980, providing three options for Canadian participation. Operation OXIDE was authorized on 22 January 1980. A team of about seventy personnel with three Caribou aircraft would deploy to Rhodesia-Zimbabwe on 2 February and return no later than 4 March. The role of the Canadian transportation unit was to provide air transport for the Commonwealth and other election observers, and for the Election Commissioner and his staff.

Once in theatre, the short take-off and landing (STOL) capabilities of the Caribous made their value apparent. They flew 370 hours, flying into small, semi-prepared landing strips. Their duties consisted of flying ballot boxes and polling booths to remote locations, and transporting the observers who would oversee the elections. For their daily taskings, they received instructions from the Office of the Election Commissioner, although they remained under Canadian command. Members of the Rhodesian Security Forces provided ground security. With the completion of the election, the team from 424 Squadron began redeploying to Canada. The first to leave were the three Caribous, as they would take the longest time. The last Caribou made it back to Canada on 13 March.

After a three-person United Nations Commission for Ruanda-Urundi had presented its report on the conditions in the trust territories to the General Assembly in June 1962, the General Assembly created a five-person United Nations Commission for Ruanda-Urundi to oversee the implementation of the transfer of power from Belgium to the two emerging nations. To assist the Commission, technical experts were requested to provide specialist advice in economics, finance, the judiciary, police and military matters. The commission presented its report on 26 May1962, after which it was dissolved. Canada provided specialist assistance to the Commission in two areas: military and police.

The refugees included armed Hutu militiamen as well as former Rwandan soldiers who had taken part in the genocide of an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutus. These militiamen and former soldiers were using the Congo as both a refuge and a launching pad for raids into Rwanda. In October 1996, Laurent Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, with support from the Rwandan Army, began a military campaign against the refugee camps, where most of the victims were women and children. Despite extensive media attention and calls for help, major nations were slow in responding. For its part, on 9 November 1996 the United Nations Security Council authorized the Secretary-General to look at the possibility of creating a multi-national force for humanitarian purposes. Subsequently, Security Council Resolution 1080 (15 November) authorized such a force under Chapter VII of the Charter, to terminate on 31 March 1997, or sooner if the Secretary-General so recommended. The force's mandate was to: By this time a mass exodus of refugees was already underway, with 600,000 reported as having returned to Rwanda by 19 November. The need for a multinational force with a Chapter VII mandate was now open to question, as the delivery of relief to the repatriated refugees now appeared to be the primary concern. Still, there were over 500,000 refugees either unaccounted for or still en-route home who probably needed assistance. An ad-hoc Steering Group, chaired by Canada, met in New York City on 21 November, with further planning taking place in Stuttgart, Germany on 22 and 23 November, Canada having volunteered to take the lead in the multinational force. Options ranged from the status quo to deploying a 10,000-man security force. Further planning continued so that by 30 November a headquarters was set up in Entebbe, Uganda, with detachments later created in four other locations in the area.

This included disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating former guerrillas, creating confidence-building measures, facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid and providing support to planned elections. This mandate was amended by Security Council Resolution 1289 of 7 February 2000, which raised UNAMSIL to a Chapter VII operation and added additional tasks, including the provision of security at key government buildings and locations, as well as at disarmament sites. UN personnel would also coordinate and assist in law enforcement. More significantly, the mandate authorized UNAMSIL to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence. The Secretary-General further amended the concept of operations in his report S/201/228 of 14 March 2001. Paragraph 58 of the report states: \"The main objectives of UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone remain to assist the efforts of the Government of Sierra Leone to extend its authority, restore law and order and stabilize the situation progressively throughout the entire country, and to assist in the promotion of a political process which should lead to a renewed disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program and the holding, in due course, of free and fair elections.\" The origins of the conflict in Sierra Leone go back to March 1991. Nigeria, in an effort to end the ongoing civil war in Liberia, attacked Liberian guerrilla leader Charles Taylor. In retaliation for Sierra Leone\u2019s allowing Nigeria to use its territory to attack his forces, Taylor armed a group of Sierra Leonian dissidents - the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). Despite changes in government and the intervention of both the Economic Community of West African States and the United Nations, the RUF continued their attacks. Sierra Leone is a multi-cultural nation of 5.3 million people. Sixty percent of the country is Muslim, 30 percent Christian, with 17 ethnic groups, two of which form the largest share of the population. In the ten-year course of the civil war, over 70,000 people were killed, 20,000 maimed through deliberate acts of amputation for terror and at least 27,000 children taken to become soldiers. An estimated 2.5 million people were either refugees or internally displaced persons. In November 1996, the UN helped to broker a peace agreement. This became redundant following a military coup in May 1997. Further negotiations led to another agreement in October 1997, with an ECOWAS Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) deployed to assist in the peacekeeping. In February 1998, rebel elements of the army attacked the ECOMOG forces, the ECOMOG counter-attacked, overthrew the military dictatorship and returned the former democratic president to power. This did not end the civil war, with the result that the Security Council authorized the creation of the UN Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) to assist the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative. UNOMSIL personnel were unarmed but were under the protection of ECOMOG forces. The UNOMSIL observers documented atrocities and human rights abuses against civilians. By December 1998, RUF forces had captured the capital of Freetown, only to lose it when ECOMOG forces retook the city in February 1999 and reinstalled the civilian government. In May 1999, the RUF agreed to negotiate. The Lome Agreement was signed on 7 July, ostensibly ending the civil war. The UN was requested to assist in maintaining the peace. The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was authorized through Security Council resolution 1270 on 22 October 1999. This terminated UNOMSIL. The initial authorized strength of UNAMSIL was 6000 military personnel, including 260 military observers. As part of the Lome Agreement, the RUF would disarm and demobilize, as would government paramilitary forces. The UN would establish assembly areas at which these forces could be demobilized and then receive training to reintegrate them in society. With the UN military forces providing security, unarmed military observers would monitor compliance with the agreement and resolve any problems. The UNAMSIL military forces would also facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, provide security to UNAMSIL\u2019s military and civilian personnel and support future elections. UNAMSIL\u2019s senior personnel would be responsible for creating confidence-building measures that would allow both parties to better implement the Lome Agreement. When the ECOMOG forces withdrew, they were not quickly replaced by UN forces. The Security Council authorized a strength of 11,100 on 7 February 2000, but this did not bring additional troops. In fact, UNAMSIL military personnel were concentrated only in the Freetown area, thereby allowing the RUF de facto control of the large areas they occupied. The RUF, apparently never fully committed to the peace agreement, handed in only a few weapons from its estimated 45,000 guerrillas. When the UN attempted to open assembly points for demobilization in RUF-controlled territory, the RUF took exception to this action. On 2 May, the RUF began attacking UN forces with the result that by 5 May, over 500 UNAMSIL personnel were taken hostage. The UN requested assistance from member nations, with India providing troops. These Indian peacekeepers freed their fellow peacekeepers, but the previous peace agreement was obviously dead. In August, British soldiers were taken hostage, prompting British forces to launch a daring assault to free their personnel. A new cease-fire was arranged in November 2000, with the Abuja Cease-fire Review Agreement (Abuja II), being signed on 2 May 2001. Abuja II included an agreement for the RUF to return UN equipment taken the previous year. This agreement has held, although minor problems have arisen. UN members contributed over 17,000 soldiers to the operation and used the threat of violence before the RUF would become active in implementing the peace agreement. Abuja II was successfully implemented. The RUF and the government released their child soldiers, demobilization and disarmament of the RUF and paramilitary government forces has been effective, and civil authority has been restored. As a result, the UN has begun a reduction of military personnel. By early 2004, the force had decreased to about 11,000 personnel, with further reductions planned as stability returns to the country.

Five CF officers deployed to Sierra Leone to act as unarmed military observers and work in the UNAMSIL headquarters. Such was the urgency of the situation that four of the personnel had deployed before the op order was issued. The concern over the security of CF personnel was paramount, with the personnel only allowed to deploy to specific locations that met specific logistical, medical and security parameters. This concern was not unfounded, as even in the authorized areas the Canadian UNMOs faced RUF intimidation. This included death threats, rifles pointed at the UNMOs and bombs placed under vehicles. In May, four returned to Canada at the end of their tour, the fifth remaining at UNAMSIL headquarters. With the outbreak of violence in May 2000, Canada answered the UN\u2019s request for assistance by providing one Airbus from No. 437 Squadron and 20 personnel to move Indian troops from New Delhi to Freetown. This operation started in mid May and lasted two weeks. Canada also provided 1700 fragmentation vests and 1700 helmets as many peacekeepers from third-world countries were deploying without these valuable pieces of protective equipment. With the UN reinforcement effort increasing, there was also a requirement for personnel to manage the huge amounts of supplies arriving at Lungi International Airport. The CF therefore contributed a Mobile Air Movements Section (MAMS), to handle freight and baggage, with ground communications support from No. 8 ACCS. The 37 members of the MAMS team deployed on 20 May via 436 Squadron Hercules, their equipment going by commercial transport aircraft. Working 12-hour shifts and in up to 43 degree temperatures, the MAMS teams off-loaded 4.7 million tons (2.4 million kgs) of freight in a 21 day period, before returning to Canada on 15 June in CF Hercules. With the situation stabilized, four UNMOs arrived at the end of June, bringing the CF contribution back to five personnel, who would rotate at six-month intervals. With the tenth rotation in January 2005, the number of personnel was reduced to three.

A peace accord was signed in 1996, but fell apart in 1997. With the renewal of the civil war, West African states sent a military force to combat the RUF. The United Nations Security Council created the United Nations Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to ensure the terms of the peace agreement signed in Lome on 7 July 1999 remained in force. This included the disarmament of the RUF and the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of all forces. On 7 February 2000 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1289 that called for the Government of Sierra Leone to create a professional and accountable armed forces and national police (paragraph 20). In April and May 2000, UN peacekeepers under UNAMSIL came under attack by rebel forces. The United Kingdom sent 1500 troops to evacuate its citizens and to support UNAMSIL. This intervention turned the tide and the rebels began to give ground and returned to the negotiation table. After the armed intervention, British troops stayed to train the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF) so these forces could disarm the rebels themselves. This process in effect created a new RSLAF, as members of both the old military and the RUF would be integrated with the RUF and other rebels forming about 15 percent of the new service. The British Army Short Term Training Team, under the name Operation Basilica (start 15 June), provided basic military training to the RSLAF and was terminated in September 2001 when it was judged that the RSLAF had sufficient trained soldiers (about 8500) to perform its tasks. At the same time, the UK organized the International Military Advisory and Training Team (IMATT), also known as the International Military Assistance Training Team, which had a much broader mandate. IMATT's mandate is: IMATT (SL) will assist with the transformation of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF) into a self-sustaining, democratically accountable and affordable force in order that it can meet Sierra Leone's defence missions and tasks and to facilitate the phased disengagement and withdrawal of IMATT (SL). What this means is that IMATT conducts a wide range of training of the RSLAF. Basic training is provided to recruits while more specialised courses in logistics, communications, command control are offered to others. IMATT's task included more than just training. There is the need to instil a professional military culture - removing links between officers and politicians - as well as instituting a system of civilian oversight of the military. The IMATT efforts are done in conjunction with the RSLAF. IMATT personnel are employed in the Ministry of Defence, RSLAF headquarters and in advisory and executive posts in sub-units. Great Britain has provided the vast majority of personnel for IMATT. Canada has provided the next largest contingent, with Bermuda, Ghana, Jamaica, Nigeria, Senegal, the United States among the nations that have also provided personnel. The strength of IMATT peaked in September 2001 at more than 600, mainly to provide short-term training to create the basis of a professional army. The number has been decreasing since then, to about 115 in February 2006.", "Name": "SCULPTURE", "Date": "6 November 2000 - Present", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada's participation in IMATT came about through a request from the United Kingdom.

This group consisted of ten individuals, both officers and senior non-commissioned members. Initially, the members were restricted to operating in the area of the Freetown peninsula; however, as the situation in Sierra Leone stabilized, the Canadians were allowed greater freedom of movement. They now operate throughout the country, performing in a variety of roles that have included helping the Sierra Leone Navy maintain its patrol boats, and providing guidance to RSLAF instructors at the Battle Schools, as well as teaching the instructors. The work with the navy has paid dividends as the Sierra Leone Navy has been able to interdict fishing vessels illegally fishing in Sierra Leone\u2019s waters, a situation that was previously not being controlled."}}, {"opName": "CORDON", "countryRegion": "Somalia", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1992-04-24", "endDate": "1993-04-30", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/cordon.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Operation in Somalia I", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM I)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Somalia", "Mission Date": "24 April 1992 - 30 April 1993", "Mission Mandate": " UNOSOM I was established by Security Council Resolution 751 (1992) of 24 April 1992 to monitor the ceasefire in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia; to provide protection and security for United Nations personnel, equipment and supplies at the seaports and airports in Mogadishu; and to escort deliveries of humanitarian supplies from there to distribution centres in the city and its immediate environs. On 28 August 1992, UNOSOM I's mandate and strength were expanded by Security Council Resolution 775 (1992) to enable it to protect humanitarian convoys and distribution centres throughout Somalia. On 3 December 1992, after the situation in Somalia had further deteriorated, the Security Council, by Resolution 794 (1992), authorized member states to form the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) to establish a safe environment for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. UNITAF worked in coordination with UNOSOM I to secure major population centres and ensure that humanitarian assistance was delivered and distributed.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " The independent state of Somalia was created in 1960 following the merger of the former colonies of Italian and British Somaliland. A democratic form of government was put in place at that time, but the power of traditional Somali clans remained strong. In the end, the democratic system established at the time of independence failed to survive as General Siad Barre led a successful military coup in 1969. By 1988 there was widespread dissatisfaction with Barre\u2019s government. The Somali National Movement (SNM) launched a guerrilla campaign but was defeated. The next year, however, two new resistance groups were formed: the United Somali Congress (USC), led by Muhamad Faarah Aideed and Ali Mahdi, and the Somali Patriotic Movement. They, along with remnants of the SNM as well as other clan-based groupings gradually took over much of the country. Barre was finally overthrown on 27 January 1991 by the sheer weight of the opposition, but his opponents could barely be said to be working together. The SNM immediately declared an independent republic in the north; the USC split into two rival factions; and although the capital, Mogadishu, suffered the most, soon clan was fighting clan throughout most of the country. The result was a humanitarian crisis of huge proportions, one made worse by the legacy of three years of drought in the area between 1985 and 1989. One million Somalis were said to be refugees in neighbouring countries, while perhaps as many as 4.5 million Somalis still in the country were in danger of malnutrition or starvation. Despite the obvious risks - Somalia was by now violently anarchic - the United Nations, Red Cross, and other non-governmental humanitarian aid organizations all did what they could to deliver assistance. For its part, the UN Security Council had already called for a ceasefire, and with the support of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Secretary General authorized a mission to help bring one about. The mission succeeded in late March, with the result that on 24 April 1992 the Security Council adopted Resolution 751 to establish a UN operation in Somalia to observe the peace and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Fifty unarmed UN military observers (UNMOs) arrived on 5 July, and within a month Aideed and Mahdi agreed to the deployment of a UN security force of some 500 soldiers. Pakistan agreed to provide these personnel, the first of whom arrived on 14 September, but despite the ceasefire and the Aideed/Mahdi agreement, clan-based factional fighting continued, not only in and around Mogadishu but also in the countryside, where heavily armed bandits were stealing humanitarian and relief supplies. Responding to what it saw, the UN Security Council agreed to increase UNOSOM\u2019s strength from 500 to 3,500 security personnel and to add three logistics units, but the situation continued to deteriorate. Looting became more widespread and violent; harbours and airports were attacked; ships were shelled; and both money and supplies were being extorted from the aid agencies to guarantee the safety of their workers. At times, even the UN troops in Mogadishu were attacked and their vehicles and weapons stolen. Reacting to the chaos, on 3 December 1992 the Security Council passed Resolution 794 authorizing member states to use \u201call necessary means to establish as soon as possible a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia\u201d. UNOSOM, in short, had become a Chapter VII operation, but it would no longer be the only military organization in the country. On 9 December, the first elements of the United States-led Unified Task Force (UNITAF) arrived in Mogadishu. UNITAF quickly expanded its operations to other major relief centres to establish a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian aid. While UNOSOM, for its part, continued to be responsible for humanitarian assistance and the political aspects of the UN\u2019s Somalia operations, the two missions would henceforth attempt to co-ordinate their activities until the end of their mandates: 30 April in the case of UNOSOM, and 4 May for UNITAF.", "Name": "CORDON", "Date": "4 September 1992 - 30 April 1993", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Whether Canada should participate in UNOSOM was a matter of considerable debate in Ottawa, primarily because its mandate seemed too vague and the security situation too fragile for what was supposed to be a Chapter VI, or peaceful, operation. But given indications that the UN might sanction more robust rules, on 4 September 1992 a warning order was issued detailing the Canadian Airborne Regiment as the Canadian Forces main contribution to UNOSOM, with HMCS Preserver and Hercules aircraft in support. However, on 4 December, Canada changed its offer: the Airborne Regiment would go to UNITAF rather than UNOSOM, and only a few staff officers would be provided to the latter.

Agricultural output fell to 30 percent of the norm, and by early 1992 an estimated 1-2 million people were at risk of starving to death. Non-government organizations (NGOs) stepped up their efforts to bring relief, while the United Nations began to take a more active role in trying to bring peace to Somalia and in delivering humanitarian assistance. After a joint request from the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme and the International Commission of the Red Cross, the CF sent a reconnaissance team to Kenya and Somalia to evaluate the situation in late August. Upon their return the decision was made to support the request, with the mission, named Operation Relief being authorized on 2 September 1992. Three CC-130 aircraft were to deploy, one supporting the WFP and one the ICRC. The third aircraft would be a spare. They would operate from Nairobi, Kenya and fly into locations as requested by the NGO coordination center. The operation was to last until 12 December 1992. The first flights took place on 11 September, with one flight each for the WFP and for the ICRC. Four flights a day were the norm thereafter. They carried a wide variety of food relief including rice, beans, and cooking oil. In October, the Hercules also began airdropping relief into remote areas to assist by the NGOs in convincing the starving to remain where they were, in their villages, rather than leaving and either embarking on a fruitless search for food elsewhere or overwhelming aid agencies in nearby towns. Although Canadian Hercules aircraft sometimes found themselves in the middle of firefights between the factions vying for control of particular areas, fortunately the crews suffered no casualties. While deliveries of aid were ongoing, plans were made to airlift Canadian troops, scheduled to participate in the United Nations Operation in Somalia (Canadian name Op Cordon). The troops were to land at Nairobi from whence the CC-130s would fly them to Bossasso. This plan changed with the decision to redeploy the Canadians to Belet Huen and participate in the American-led Unified Task Force (Canadian name Op Deliverance). This delayed the operation, which now started on 28 December 1992. Thereafter, the three Hercules supported not only Op Relief, but also Op Deliverance. On 30 December the decision was made to extend Op Relief until 31 January 1993. This was further extended one more time, to 28 February 1993, at which time Operation Relief was terminated. The three CC-130 Hercules remained in Nairobi from which they continued to operate in support of Op Deliverance. They also participated in the WFP\u2019s Operation Lifeline Sudan (Canadian name Op Sudan). The totals for Op Relief were 290 flights, 594 passengers and 4100 tons of relief for the World Food Programme and 257 flights, 297 passengers and 3100 tons of relief for the International Commission of the Red Cross.

They also began identifying former members of the local police force who, once issued identification cards and uniforms, and paid with food, patrolled the streets with CARBG soldiers.\u00a0\n\nFor its part, 93 RWAF had a large mandate \u2013 supporting the Canadian, Australian, Belgian and Italian contingents through reconnaissance flights (especially at night, to find armed bandit vehicles), medical evacuations and troop transport. They also helped in keeping open the \u201cChina Road\u201d, the only good route between Belet Huen and Matabaan in central Somalia, which had been cleared of mines and partly reconstructed by 29 Field Squadron and was routinely patrolled the CARBG.\n\nThe Canadians of the CARBG and 93 RWAF were withdrawn in early June. In a huge convoy, the CARBG drove to Mogadishu, where their vehicles were loaded onto a ship on 14 June. The helicopters of 93 RWAF returned on USAF C-5 Galaxy flights, with the last 93 RWAF personnel departing on 12 June. The ALCE redeployed most of the Op DELIVERANCE personnel out of Somalia. (As a precaution when the violence of 5 June occurred, the ALCE had evacuated over 200 Canadians to Nairobi on 9 June.)

Apartheid started to take a more concrete form after the Second World War, as laws were enacted that restricted the rights of black and coloured peoples. Violence associated with these laws reached international attention in March 1960 with the Sharpeville Massacre. International pressure, including sanctions, instituted as a result of these repressive acts and laws slowly took effect upon white South Africa\u2019s economy. The African National Congress, formed in 1912 to champion the cause of freedom and dignity of black South Africans, had been active since 1949 with boycotts, mass resistance, and strikes. In the 1980s, community organizations formed across black South Africa, leading to a mass movement opposing apartheid. In the face of these and other sources of pressure, the white government of South Africa began to take steps designed to provide a transition to a fully representational government. On 14 September 1991 representatives of twenty-seven political parties, interest groups and national and homeland governments signed the National Peace Accord. As part of the Accord, a multi-racial Transitional Executive Council was created to serve as a temporary executive authority until democratic elections could be held. Despite the agreement, peace in South Africa was not at hand. The African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party were still involved in a civil war in KwaZulu and Natal provinces, which had killed more than 10,000 over the previous decade. The Zulu population was split between these two parties, while the Inkatha party was itself split over leadership. The National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) was created as a 3150-member unit to be deployed to areas of violence or civil unrest, or where the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) deemed it necessary to protect lives and property. The NPKF base was at the De Brug Training Camp near Blomfontein for three battalions and one camp near Cape Town for a fourth. The NPKF was a multi-racial unit formed from military members of the South African Defence Force, the uMkhontho weSizwe (the African National Congress\u2019 armed wing) and the Transkei (one of the \u201cblack\u201d homelands), as well as South African Police, and the Transkei, Bophuthatsuma, Venda and Ciskei (TBVC) defence and police forces. Each NPKF platoon was composed of members from each of these forces. Elections for South Africa were slated for 29 April 1994. To ensure fairness, the TEC requested the United Nations to provide international observers, which subsequently developed into the United Nations Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA). The Commonwealth (Commonwealth Observer Mission in South Africa - COMSA), and the European Union and Organization of African Unity also maintained missions in South Africa at the request of that nation. To combat violence, the NPKF was to be deployed to areas of concern. The TEC requested in early February 1994 that the Commonwealth provide a Commonwealth Peacekeeping Assistance Group (CPAG) to assist in the training of the NPKF. CPAG would be responsive to the TEC for training; however, the operations and employment of CPAG members was ontrolled by COMSA. Initially, the CPAG was to consist of sixteen army and police personnel; however, this was later expanded to a total of thirty-three. The goal was to create a unified force capable of deploying by the end of March 1994. The CPAG would advise South African personnel on how and what to train the NPKF. This included crowd control, electoral procedures, maintenance of law and order, mediation, riot prevention, and use of minimum force. Prior to the arrival of the CPAG members, the NPKF was, to quote a newspaper report, \u201cin shambles\u201d. There was a lack of discipline, and former South African Defence Force (SADF) volunteers reportedly refused to obey orders from NPKF personnel. Originally, the SADF had wanted six months to train the force; however, due to delays in negotiations, this was reduced to seven weeks. It was this environment that the CPAG encountered. Most of the personnel arrived around 21 February and were almost immediately thrust into a training role. Bringing the NPKF up to international standards took longer than expected. Instead of being ready by the end of March, it was considered to be only partly ready for deployment by mid-April.", "Canadian Task Force Name Abbreviation": "CPAG-SA", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " The Canadian Forces provided two majors to the CPAG, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police two members.

Famine, as much a result of drought as civil war, became a serious problem in 1986. By late 1988 an estimated 250,000 people had died of hunger-related diseases, and one million people were displaced. Both the Sudanese government and the SPLA and supporters of each conducted \u201cscorched earth \u201c policies and denied the delivery of relief. The United Nations estimated conservatively that a further 100,000 people would die in 1989 if emergency aid was not delivered quickly, and that over 2.2 million were directly affected by famine. A UN-sponsored conference on relief operations held in Khartoum in March 1989 had considerable international support.\n\nIn April 1989, the United Nations authorized Operation LIFELINE SUDAN (OLS). The operation brought together almost 40 UN and non-governmental organizations in an effort to deliver aid to those in need. To do this, OLS negotiated eight \u201ccorridors of tranquillity\u201d with the Government and the SPLA. Within two months 16,000 tons of aid had been delivered throughout the southern Sudan by aircraft, barge, train and truck. This was more than all aid delivered in the period 1983 to 1988. The OLS thus became the first UN humanitarian program to negotiate with combatants to gain access for the delivery of aid.\n\nThe period of \u201ctranquillity\u201d was short-lived however. Government and SPLA forces were fighting again in October 1989. Fighting spread not only throughout the south, but also into the western Darfur region. Again, one of the aims of both sides was to deny access of aid to displaced persons in the territory held by the opposing force. OLS, which had been operating in the midst of the civil war, temporarily halted operations in September 1992 after the SPLA killed three UN workers and a photojournalist. To this point they had been permitted by the government into only six sites in southern Sudan.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis again started to grow to alarming proportions. International pressure again resulted in peace talks. One result was that the SPLA, now with three tribally-based factions, agreed to allow relief to flow into southern Sudan in December 1992. The government also relented. The OLS was permitted to expand delivery of aid to 40 locations in the south; however, even this was struggle.\n\nPeace talks broke down in May 1993 and in June the civil war restarted. To make matters worse, SPLA factions fought against each other. Food aid was again a tool of war. The government, while restricting international agencies, allowed unimpeded access to Islamic organizations that used relief to proselytise. OLS continues its attempts to deliver relief into Sudan, but has been hindered by all sides and their use of food aid as a means of waging the war.\n\nCanadian Forces participation began in March 1993. On 1 March, UNICEF asked the Canadian Ambassador at the United Nations if the Canadian Forces could make available one Hercules for a ten-day period. The lone UNICEF-chartered aircraft had developed mechanical problems that could not be quickly repaired. By 6 March, approval had been granted for a recce party to determine the viability of the mission and mission requirements.\u00a0\n\nOn 26 March, approval was given for Operation SUDAN, DND assistance to Operation Lifeline Sudan and UNICEF. One CC-130 Hercules aircraft, in support of Operation DELIVERANCE in Somalia was tasked to support the operation, subject to the requirements of Op Deliverance. Each day, starting 27 March, the Hercules would leave Nairobi and fly a load of aid to a location in Sudan. The aircraft would then fly to Lokichogio, Kenya \u2013 the base of operations for OLS - to pick up the next load and refuel.\n\nThe operation continued until 9 April, at which time the Hercules returned to its duties in support of Op Deliverance."}}, {"opName": "SAFARI", "countryRegion": "Sudan", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "2004-06-11", "endDate": "2005-03-24", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/safari.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Advance Mission in Sudan (UNAMIS), United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS)", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Advance Mission in Sudan (UNAMIS), United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS)", "Mandating Organization": " United Nations Security Council Resolution 1547, 11 June 2004 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1590, 24 March 2005\n", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Sudan", "Mission Date": "22 July 2004 - present", "Mission Mandate": " Established as a political mission dedicated to prepare for the international monitoring called for by the 25 September 2003 Naivasha Agreement on Security Arrangements, to facilitate contacts with the parties concerned and to prepare for the introduction of a peace support operation following the signing of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement.

The United Nations first became involved in the country in April 1989, when Operation LIFELINE SUDAN was authorized to provide humanitarian assistance to drought-ravaged areas. Attempts at assisting in brokering a political settlement followed, and in January 2002 the conflicting parties agreed to a peace framework. An accord was signed in September 2003, and the next month the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to initiate preparatory work on how the UN could best fully support the implementation of a comprehensive peace agreement between the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), which had been waging a civil war for over 20 years, in effect splitting Sudan into a northern and a southern area. The conflict pitted the Islamic north against the mainly Christian and pagan southern rebels, with issues such as oil and ethnicity complicating matters. After studying the situation, in June 2004 the Secretary General recommended the creation of the United Nations Advanced Mission in Sudan (UNAMIS). The Security Council supported this recommendation and in September 2004 it passed Resolution 1547 (2004) authorizing the creation and deployment of UNAMIS. UMAMIS was tasked to prepare the way for a follow-on UN mission that would monitor the ceasefire and any follow-on agreements.\n\nA Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed on 9 January 2005 between the Government of Sudan and the SPLM/A. A preliminary agreement was signed between the GOS and the National Democratic Alliance, another rebel group, on 17 January, bringing hope that peace was in sight . After the agreements and the work prepared by UNAMIS, the Security Council passed Resolution 1590 on 24 March 2005 and established the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS). The Resolution also transferred all functions performed by the special political mission in Sudan (UNAMIS) to UNMIS effectively terminating UNAMIS.\n\nUNMIS was to consist of 10,000 military personnel plus a civilian component. The first UN troops, from Nepal, began arriving on 27 April 2005. They would be joined by contingents from Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Kenya and Zambia, as well as smaller contingents from western countries. Their area of operations was throughout southern Sudan, but would not involve the Darfur region of western Sudan, which was being monitored by an African Union mission.\n\nCanada\u2019s participation in the recent efforts in Sudan began with UNAMIS, the participation being named Operation SAFARI. With the creation of UNMIS, Canada agreed to send both headquarters staff to support the UN mission and military observers to oversee the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and report on and investigate any violations. The headquarters staff were drawn from the Canadian contribution to the United Nations Standby High Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG), as a result of which they would only be deployed for six months.\u00a0\n\nThe commander of SHIRBRIG, Brigadier-General Greg Mitchell (Canada), was designated Deputy Force Commander of UNMIS. SHIRBRIG deployed form early April to Oct 2005 for a six month deployment. Canada also augmented the UNMIS Headquarters staff providing five Canadian Forces members for the leadership of the headquarters company, bringing its total Canadian contribution to 15 personnel. The commitment for a recurring six-month contribution of military observers was for 12 persons.\n\nThe headquarters component was increased to nine and the UN Military Observer (UNMO) component to 25. The headquarters staff operates out of Khartoum, with one person in El Obeid. The UNMOs can be deployed in any of the six UNMIS sectors, although an effort is made to keep Canadians in pairs at any location to which they are deployed."}}, {"opName": "SATURN", "countryRegion": "Sudan", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "2008-01-01", "endDate": "2019-02-23", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/saturn.html", "details": {"Name": "Operation SATURN", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Assistance Mission in Darfur (UNAMID)", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Mandate": "Operation SATURN is the deployment of a Canadian Armed Forces team to serve with UNAMID, the hybrid operation by the African Union (A.U.) and the United Nations in Darfur.", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Darfur, Sudan", "Mission Date": "1 January 2008 - on going", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Darfur is the western province of Sudan.

Intervention in the Darfur crisis began with assistance from the A.U., which collaborated with the U.N. and other international organizations to bring representatives of the SLA and the JEM to negotiate with the Government of Sudan.\u00a0\n\nThe war in Darfur officially ended on 5 May 2006 with the signature of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) by representatives of the Government of Sudan, the SLA/M and the JEM. Its primary goals were to establish an effective ceasefire and security arrangements, and to secure agreement on how power and wealth are to be shared. The effort to bring other combatant groups into the peace process continues.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, the fighting went on, and vast refugee camps formed in frontier areas and in neighbouring countries. From its outset, the conflict has been marked by atrocities against civilians, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the displacement of millions of Sudanese residents.

On 16 November 2006, high-level talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, led the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations to implement a three-phased plan to expand AMIS and, eventually, to deploy a hybrid A.U.U.N. mission in Darfur.\u00a0\n\nIntensive private and public diplomacy by U.N.

On 4 August 1972, he announced that the country\u2019s 80,000 Asians had 90 days to leave the country. This was amended two days later so that only those Asians who did not have Ugandan citizenship would be expelled. This still amounted to an estimated 60,000 people, most of whom had British citizenship and were mainly third-generation Ugandans brought to the country by the former British colonial regime. They were told that they could leave with only that which they could carry and would not be compensated for homes, businesses and possessions left behind. The expulsion order took Britain by surprise: it had been taking in about one thousand Asian-Ugandans a year, but accepting sixty thousand at one time was beyond its capacity - there was a risk of serious domestic problems. In the face of the humanitarian crisis created by the expulsion, Canada agreed to accept 4,400 Asian-Ugandans into Canada. The lead agency would be the Department of Manpower and Immigration. The Canadian Forces would assist by providing accommodation, food services, medical facilities and transportation upon the arrival of the refugees in Canada. With one week\u2019s notice, the Longue Pointe detachment of CFB Montreal was converted into a reception centre. As the refugees arrived on Air Canada, CP Air and Pacific Western flights, they were transported to Longue Pointe. The gymnasium became a reception centre, while three old barracks became a temporary hospital, a press centre and clothing store. A group of 20 military cooks from Gagetown, London, Montreal, Petawawa and Valcartier quickly learned the intricacies of cooking Asian meals, as well as the different food requirements of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. A medical unit from 5e Groupement de Combat provided a small hospital, and acted as liaison with two Montreal hospitals that had volunteered their assistance if required. They also inoculated all Asians as they arrived as a precaution against various diseases, including smallpox, which had been reported in Uganda. Even casual visitors to the reception centre were inoculated. After flights lasting about 19 hours, on arrival at Longue Pointe the refugees were treated to a hot meal, given inoculations and informed as to what would happen to them next. Most stayed no more than two days at Longue Pointe, as Manpower and Immigration personnel worked quickly to find places in Canada to stay based upon their education and previous employment.

The Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) began to wage a guerrilla was to overthrow Amin. On 11 April 1979 Amin fled Uganda and an interim government organized. The UNLA, which had received substantial assistance from the Tanzanian military in defeating Amin, now became the National army. In the period of the interim government that followed, several leaders within the UNLA began to organize their own private armies. Yoweri Museveni formed the National Resistance Army (NRA), rapidly increasing it in size from 80 to 8,000 soldiers. Obote returned to Uganda and won the disputed election of 10 December 1980.\n\nThe UNLA increased from 600 to 24,000 in less than two years. Many of the soldiers were from ethnic groups that had been harshly treated by Amin. With minimal military training and now fighting the NRA, some UNLA soldiers avenged themselves against the inhabitants of Amin's home region. Obote began to re-establish cordial international relations and to rebuild the shattered economy. However, any gains were swallowed by the futile attempts to defeat the NRA. The repression that had been symbolic of Amin's regime began to return.\n\nFaced with the problems of a trying to rebuild the economy and fight the NRA, Obote asked for assistance. In 1982, Great Britain organized the Commonwealth Military Training Team in Uganda (CMTT) to train and organize the UNLA. The Commonwealth Secretariat requested members of the Commonwealth for assistance, with Australia, Canada, Guyana, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and the United Kingdom all providing personnel. The CMTT consisted of 37 members operating from the town of Jinja, 50 kms east of Kampala. The CMTT provided training to officers at various ranks in military skills, small unit tactics and where appropriate in battalion operations and leadership. Warrant officers and sergeant were trained in drill and small unit tactics The organization only lasted from about 18 March 1982 to 24 March 1984.\n\nDespite the work of the CMTT, their efforts were too small given the overall size of the UNLA. Given the continued failure of the UNLA to defeat the NRA, Obote in early 1983 authorized the forced move of over 750,000 civilians in the Luwero area in which the NRA had its greatest support. Civilians not living in the government-organized camps were assumed to be hostile. The police began systematic abductions and torture to find NRA supporters, while the military conducted indiscriminate attacks on alleged supporters of the NRA. Obote also signed agreements with North Korea, one of which allowed North Korean soldiers to deploy thirty officers to Uganda to conduct infantry training in Gulu. During the 1980s, these North Koreans often led UNLA soldiers into combat against the NRA. Obote's regime is estimated to have killed 500,000 people. The regime fell on 27 July 1985.\n\nIn early 1982, Canada received a request to participate in the CMTT. A three-person medical team consisting of a medial officer major, and two medical assistants (a warrant officer and a sergeant) was authorized. They left Canada on 6 April, arriving in Jinja on 14 April. Operating from this location, they treated the members of the CMTT, but more frequently provided medical attention to the Ugandan soldiers. The biggest problem they treated was malaria, which during the period they were there could be effectively treated using chloroquine. However, by the time the three Canadians left, chloroquine-resistant malaria was making its debut in the area. Parasites such as hookworm, roundworm and tapeworm were common problems as were venereal disease and tuberculosis. They would also on occasion treat civilians. Their mission lasted to 3 September 1982 after which Canada did not renew its participation."}}, {"opName": "LANCE", "countryRegion": "Uganda and Rwanda", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1993-06-22", "endDate": "1994-09-21", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/lance.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR)", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Uganda and Rwanda", "Mission Date": "22 June 1993 - 21 September 1994", "Mission Mandate": " UNOMUR was deployed on the Ugandan side of the border between Uganda and Rwanda in accordance with Security Council Resolution 846 of 22 June 1993.

Many Tutsi were expelled then, and more still following another coup in 1973. Most fled to Uganda where, having formed the Rwandese Patriotic Front in the late 1980s, they began to launch cross-border attacks into Rwanda in October 1990. Over the next year, a number of cease-fires were broken by neighbouring states, but all were broken. As a result of yet another such arrangement, this time by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the government of Tanzania on 22 July 1992, a 50-person Neutral Military Observer Group (NMOG 1) was deployed by the OAU, but fighting resumed in February 1993 despite its presence. The OAU again sponsored talks, and the Arusha Peace Agreement, signed in August, again called for an OAU observer group. (NMOG II). In the interim, however, both Rwanda and Uganda requested a UN presence along their common border in order to prevent its use by the RPF. On 22 June 1993, the Security Council passed Resolution 846, which created the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR). The mandate of UNOMUR was simple: to ensure that no military aid reached Rwanda. UNOMUR would also assist the NMOG II by placing two military experts in logistics at NMOG II\u2019s disposal.

The Security Council\u2019s rationale for preventing weapons and war materiel from reaching the RPF was to prevent any further outbreak of violence between the Rwandan government and the RPF.\u00a0\n\nUNOMUR could not deploy to Uganda before a status of mission agreement had been reached. This was not concluded until 16 August 1993. The advance party arrived two days later, setting up UNOMUR headquarters in Kabale, Uganda, about 20 kilometres north of the border. By the end of September, UNOMUR had reached its authorized strength of 81 personnel.\u00a0\n\nTo conduct its operations, UNOMUR established two observation posts at major border crossings and three secondary posts at minor crossings. Suspect traffic could be inspected and these activities were augmented by mobile patrols. UNOMUR did not, however, cover the entire border. But, in his first progress report on UNOMUR, issued on 15 December 1993, the Secretary-General indicated that UNOMUR had played a useful role as a confidence-building mechanism.\u00a0\n\nThe status of UNOMUR also changed during this first period. On 5 October 1993, the Security Council created the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). UNAMIR was to support the Arusha Agreement, monitoring the cease-fire, assisting in humanitarian activities and investigating non-compliance with the Agreement. The Security Council also agreed to integrate UNOMUR into UNAMIR.\u00a0\n\nHowever, events rapidly took a turn for the worse. On 6 April 1994, the airplane carrying Burundi\u2019s President Cyprien Ntaryamira and Rwanda\u2019s President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana crashed at Kigali airport in Rwanda. This set off three months of genocide in which over 800,000 men, women and children were killed. Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed using any weapon available. The genocide only stopped when the RPF took over control of the country.\u00a0\n\nWhen the genocide began, UNOMUR was able to extend its area of coverage to the entire border. UNOMUR\u2019s patrols continued and with the addition of three helicopters, UNOMUR\u2019s capabilities were strengthened. UNOMUR was able to assist UNAMIR to some extent in addressing the question of outside interference in the civil war and genocide in Rwanda. By being able to patrol the entire border they quickly discovered that the Rwandan Government Forces were receiving supplies over land from Bukavu and Goma in Zaire and by boat across Lake Kivu. UNOMUR also noted that the Ugandan Army was hindering UNOMUR operations. To counter this, the UNOMUR Deputy Commander, Colonel Azrul Haque of Bangladesh, deployed UNMOs along the border and, not surprisingly, they reported significant traffic between Rwanda and Uganda. This brought a truer picture of the state of supplies going to the two sides.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps of greater significance was the assistance UNOMUR military and civilian staff provided directly to UNAMIR. UNOMUR personnel coordinated logistics activities at Entebbe airport for UNAMIR. Once ready, convoys of food, materiel and incoming UNAMIR personnel were escorted to the border. UNOMUR staff also assisted with the evacuation of UNAMIR casualties from Rwanda.\u00a0\n\nIn June 1994 the Secretary-General suggested that there was little value in patrolling only one of Rwanda\u2019s borders while the civil war raged. He therefore recommended that UNOMUR\u2019s mandate be extended only until 21 September and that its operations be phased down starting in August. On 15 August, UNOMUR\u2019s strength was reduced to fifty-five, on 30 August to forty-six, and on 6 September to thirty-four. Canada\u2019s participation in UNOMUR was named Operation LANCE. On 27 May 1993 Brigadier-General Rom\u00e9o Dallaire was advised he was to be the UNOMUR Force Commander when the Security Council approved the mission. Although he was military head of UNOMUR, Dallaire spent considerable time before October preparing for what everyone knew had to be \u2013 a UN mission in Rwanda \u2013 and almost all his time in Rwanda thereafter was associated with that mission, of which he was also Force Commander. After his departure from Africa on 20 August 1994, he was replaced as Chief Military Office for UNOMUR by Major General Guy Tousignant, who remained in that post until UNOMUR was terminated on 20 September.\u00a0\n\nOverall, four Canadian officers served with UNOMUR. The actual nature of their participation was more administrative than operational, due to the requirements of setting up two missions at the same time."}}, {"opName": "SOLITUDE", "countryRegion": "West Africa", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "2002-11-27", "endDate": "2004-07-15", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/solitude.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Special Representative of the Secretary General in West Africa", "International Mission Name": "Special Representative of the Secretary General in West Africa (SRSG-WA)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "West Africa", "Mission Date": "27 November 2002 - 15 July 2004", "Name": "SOLITUDE", "Date": "19 March 2003 - 15 April 2004", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": "To find a resolution to the border dispute over the Bakassi peninsula, between the West African nations of Nigeria and Cameroon.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " For a number of years relations between neighboring Cameroon and Nigeria have been strained over issues relating to their 1,600-kilometre land boundary, extending from the Lake Chad to the Bakassi peninsula, and their maritime boundary into the Gulf of Guinea. Among the issues involved are rights over oil-rich land and sea reserves and the fate of local populations. Comprised of about 1,000 km2 of mangrove swamp, the Bakassi Peninsula is located on the west coast of Africa, between Nigeria to the northwest and Cameroon to the southeast. About 70,000 people occupy its few habitable areas. The Gulf of Guinea, into which the Bakassi Peninsula extends, includes Africa's richest oil fields. To ensure an equitable settlement, the matter was referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Weeks before the ICJ judgment was rendered, the UN Secretary General invited president Paul Biya of Cameroon and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria to meet and discuss the implementation of the upcoming judgment. In a joint statement issued on 5 September 2002, both presidents agreed to respect and implement the ICJ decision, and to establish an implementation mechanism. On 10 October 2002, the ICJ settled the long-standing dispute over the sovereignty of the Bakassi Peninsula by awarding Bakassi to Cameroon. On 23 October, Nigeria announced that it would not recognize the ICJ ruling as the people of Bakassi were largely Nigerian. To prevent a possible conflict from erupting over the Peninsula, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, announced on 27 November the creation of a mixed commission under the chairmanship of the Special Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG) West Africa, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, to settle the dispute via diplomatic means. In late January of 2003, both presidents and the Secretary General met in Geneva Switzerland and agreed upon a comprehensive working plan for the withdrawal of civilian administration, military and police forces in the Lake Chad area. As a result of the agreement, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations at the United Nations requested a senior officer of the Canadian Forces to serve in West Africa as Military Advisor and Senior Military Liaison Officer to the SRSG West Africa. This request was made on the behalf of the UN Department of Political Affairs. Canada agreed and sent one officer to Dakar, Senegal in March of 2003 under the operation name Operation SOLITUDE. This tasking was of particular interest to the Canadian government since the target region for the Peace and Security Initiative of Canada's Africa Action Plan was West Africa. By providing the SRSG West Africa with a Senior Military Liaison Officer, Canada believed that it would have a good opportunity to make a significant contribution to the mission, and to gain valuable insight into the workings of the sub-region. The tasking period was for one year. The mandate of the Mixed Commission was to clearly define the boundary between the two countries; protect the rights of the people of both countries; develop projects to promote joint economic ventures and cross-border cooperation; reactivate the Lake Chad Basin Commission; and oversee the withdrawal of civil administration, military and police forces and transfer of authority in relevant areas along the boundary. The Mixed Commission met every two months, and at its ninth meeting in Yaounde in April 2004, it decided that the process for withdrawal and transfer of authority in the Land Boundary would start on 15 June, and end on 15 July 2004; and that the process of withdrawal and transfer of authority on the Bakassi Peninsula would start on 15 July and be completed by 15 September 2004."}}, {"opName": "PYTHON", "countryRegion": "Western Sahara", "continent": "Africa", "startDate": "1991-04-29", "endDate": "2019-02-23", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/africa/python.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Misi\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para el refer\u00e9ndum del S\u00e0hara Occidental", "International Mission Name": "Misi\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para el refer\u00e9ndum del S\u00e0hara Occidental (MINURSO)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Africa", "Location": "Western Sahara", "Mission Date": "29 April 1991 - Present", "Mission Mandate": " Security Council Resolution 690 of 29 April 1991 established the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).

A temporary government would be created with the participation of the Jema\u2019a, a local assembly created by Spain in 1967. In April 1976, Morocco and Mauritania reached an agreement, with Jema\u2019a approval, that would cede the northern two-thirds of the territory to Morocco and the southern third to Mauritania. This agreement was not universally acclaimed. The Frente Popular para la Liberaci\u00f3n de Saguia el-Hamra y de R\u00edo de Oro (Polisario Front) had been created in May 1973 as a voice for the people of Western Sahara, although it did not represent them all. The Polisario Front objected to the April 1976 agreement and began guerrilla operations to support their claim that, not being democratically elected, the Jema\u2019a could not and did not speak for the people of Western Sahara. From secure bases in Algeria, the Polisario Front raided Mauritanian and Moroccan installations before retreating to the safety of Algerian territory. By 1979, the Polisario Front had reached an agreement with Mauritania that saw the latter renounce all claims to Western Sahara. Moroccan troops meanwhile moved into the southern third of the territory, where they increasingly came into conflict with the Polisario Front. At its 1979 summit, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) called for a referendum in Western Sahara to allow the people of the territory the right to self determination. The King of Morocco agreed to the proposal in 1981; however, it was not until 1988 that Morocco and the Polisario Front reached any form of agreement. On 30 August, both parties agreed in principle to \u201cthe settlement proposals\u201d that stipulated a cease-fire and a referendum to allow the people of Western Sahara the right to choose between independence or integration with Morocco. In September 1988 the Security Council approved the creation of a special representative; however it was not until June 1990 that an agreement on the implementation of the \u201csettlement proposals\u201d was reached. The proposals called for the UN Special Representative to have full control over the referendum and to be assisted by UN civilian, military and civilian police personnel. The civilian component would comprise between 800 to 1000 personnel, the military 1,700 and the civilian police 300 officers. The transition period would start with a cease-fire and end with the declaration of the referendum results. For the cease-fire, Morocco would reduce its military forces to 65,000 in Western Sahara, while troops of both forces would be confined to designated areas. Political prisoners would then be released, prisoners of war exchanged and a repatriation program initiated. Eligible voters would be identified prior to the referendum, which would be organized and run by the UN. The Security Council approved this plan through resolution 690 on 21 April 1991, thus creating the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). The whole mission was expected to last no more than 26 weeks, of which 20 would be of the transitional period. The first force commander was Major-General Armand Roy, from Canada, who remained in that post until April 1992. His mission began under a cloud when fighting broke out before the formal cease-fire was to come into effect, but in the end it was in effect on 6 September. MINURSO military forces were in place, and by 20 September six observation posts had been manned.

The Polisario Front contended that only individuals registered in the 1974 had the right to vote. Morocco, which had resettled citizens into Western Sahara, held a more liberal interpretation of who could vote, although they accepted the criteria enunciated by the UN Secretary-General in December 1991. Not until November 1993 was an agreement reached, although the Polisario Front\u2019s agreement was tentative at best.

According to the original MINURSO plans, their expected length of deployment was six months. A warning order for Operation PYTHON was issued that day. Due to changes in the situation in the Western Sahara, Canada added twenty-two military police, eight headquarters orderly room staff, and one colonel (as a liaison officer to Algeria) to its contingent, and substituted eleven UNMOs for the five staff officers originally committed. The infantry battalion selected for Op PYTHON was the Canadian Airborne Regiment, who were scheduled to deploy and be operationally ready by 1 November and then remain in theatre for four months. Their tasks were to include monitoring and patrolling in support of the UNMOs, manning three entry points along the border with Algeria, and providing security for the repatriation of refugees and at MINURSO headquarters and refugee reception centres. However, because of delays in implementing the agreement proposals they never deployed and instead remained on standby until February 1992. Fourteen Canadians were deployed in early September, arriving in Western Sahara on the 5th. These included the headquarters staff and UNMOs. They were soon joined by two Canadian military engineers employed by UN headquarters in New York. By 6 September, two of the Canadian UNMOs had deployed on observer teams. Other personnel for the headquarters, movement control unit and UNMOs followed rapidly, and by the end of December 1991, the Canadian Contingent MINURSO reached its maximum deployed strength of thirty four. Eleven were UNMOs, nine served in movement control, thirteen in MINURSO headquarters as staff and one liaison officer in Tindouf, Algeria. The first rotation of personnel, which saw the UNMO tour length increase to one year, began in April 1992. Five of the Canadians already in Western Sahara indicated that they would be happy to extend their tour, and their offer was accepted. Another three personnel were extended due to their positions within MINURSO. Further rotations occurred in September 1992, March 1993, and October 1993, but lack of progress and commitment by the interested parties led Canada to withdraw its military personnel from MINURSO at the end of June 1994.

The refugees included armed Hutu militiamen and former Rwandan soldiers who had taken part in the genocide of an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutus. These militiamen and former soldiers were using Congo as both a refuge and a launching pad for raids into Rwanda. In October 1996, Laurent Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, with support from the Rwandan Army, began a military campaign against the refugee camps, where most of the victims were women and children.

Planning for Operation Sabre began the next day, and following Cabinet approval an advance party was ready to leave for Zambia on 22 December. That same day, at the request of the Minister of National Defence, the operation name was changed from Sabre to Nimble. Initially seen as a four-week commitment, on 5 January 1966 the Canadian Cabinet agreed that Nimble should be extended to the end of April, but with a reduced number of aircraft (two, instead of four) after 1 March. The concept of operations was that the RCAF CC-130 Hercules would fly bulk petroleum products into Zambia, either in drums or in inflatable \u201cpillows.\u201d Ndjili airport, outside Leopoldville, Congo would be the base of operations, with aircraft flying into Lusaka and Ndola, Zambia. The RCAF contingent of about 150 personnel, air and ground crew, would be under the operational control of the local Royal Air Force commander. The advance party arrived in Leopoldville on 24 December, making arrangements for the start of the oil lift, Hercules operations and accommodations for the air and ground crew. The four Hercules, two from 435 Squadron and two from 436 Squadron, departed on 26, 28 and 29 December, and 2 January, each aircraft taking two days to fly to Leopoldville. Operations out of Ndjili began on 27 December utilizing the Yukon that had carried the advance party. The first Hercules flight took place on 30 December. The plan was to fly 700 hours a month, with two, and then three shuttle runs daily to Elisabethville/Ndola; and one to Lusaka, until two aircraft returned to Canada on 1 March. While the initial concept was that 45-gallon drums would be replaced by fuel cells or \u201cpillows,\u201d drums remained in use throughout the operation.

Warlords and militia leaders who had worked together to oust the Soviet-backed regime now jostled for power, sometimes switching allegiances in breathtakingly short spans of time. By 2001 the Taliban had gained control of 80 percent of the country, and although by everyone\u2019s accounting they could be described as religious fundamentalists there was nevertheless hope that they might bring stability to the country. However, the Taliban were also providing shelter to (and helping to train) the terrorists of Al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, and when they refused to hand over bin Laden after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the United Nations and NATO backed efforts to unseat this terrorist-supporting regime. The resulting military operation, named Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, was part of the greater \u201cCampaign Against Terrorism\u201d. The United Nations had actually been involved in providing aid to Afghanistan and its refugees since before the Soviet departure. In addition, UN representatives had been attempting to reconcile the various groups within the country and provide a stable government and peace. With the American-led attack upon the Taliban, the possibility for reconciliation increased among those who were opposed to the regime, and in December 2001, a number of prominent Afghans met in Bonn, Germany under the auspices of the United Nations. On 5 December they signed the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan Pending the Re-establishment of Permanent Government Institutions, known as the Bonn Agreement, witnessed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan. The Agreement created an Afghan Interim Authority, composed of 30 members, who would govern the country. Their goal was to create within six months the conditions for a Transitional Authority that would lead to a Loya Jirga (the traditional Afghan Grand Council) in two years. The Interim Authority was inaugurated in Kabul on 22 December 2001, with the Loya Jirga taking place in June 2002. The Afghan Interim Authority knew that they would face a daunting task, having to not only rebuild the entire economy and infrastructure of the country but also to re-establish the tools of government, all the while reconciling independent-minded warlords and defeating the Taliban who still remained a power in Afghanistan. On 4 January 2002 the AIA signed a Military Technical Agreement with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). ISAF is an ad-hoc organization, composed mainly of NATO members, formed to provide assistance to the AIA. Under the offer of the United Kingdom to organize and lead ISAF, on 10 January 2002 Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding in London, formalising their contributions to the force. Belgium signed the Memorandum later while Bulgaria agreed to contribute personnel. On 14 March, the Czech Republic signed the Memorandum, offering to contribute a military field hospital. Although not a United Nations operation, ISAF operates under a UN mandate issued under a Chapter VII Security Council Resolution 1386 of 20 December 2001. The mandate has been expanded and altered three times, under Resolutions 1413, 23 May 2002, 1444, 27 November 2002 and 1510, 13 October 2003, all of which were Chapter VII mandates. These mandates authorized ISAF to support the AIA, the ATA and the Government of Afghanistan. The initial mandates were for the area around Kabul; however, this was expanded in Resolution 1510, which allowed ISAF to operate in any area of Afghanistan at the request of Afghani authorities. Pending the arrival of ISAF forces - the first of the 5,000 arrived in Kabul on 1 January 2002 -- British troops already in Afghanistan provided an interim force. Among the tasks ISAF performed were providing security in Kabul, disposing of munitions, training the new Afghan National Army, and disarming the various militia groups. Patrols of Kabul were conducted with the Kabul City Police. On a political level, ISAF worked closely with the Afghani authorities and the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (see separate entry). ISAF also collaborated with non-governmental organisations and United Nations relief agencies to coordinate, provide, and protect humanitarian operations, infrastructure repair, and emergency relief following natural disasters like the 25 March 2002 earthquake in the North. Its support to the Afghan authorities was designed to allow the Afghans to take the lead and develop their own institutions and capabilities as quickly as possible. Joint patrols were conducted with the Afghan military and Kabul City Police, but when it came to raids and other operations where force was involved, ISAF supported, rather than led, to reaffirm the fact that its goal was to assist, not supplant, local authority. After 23 years of civil war, and in a city with over 3.5 million people, many of whom were displaced and living in shanty towns and refugee camps, this was not an easy task. In December 2003, the North Atlantic Council authorised NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander to expand the mission to include a German-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in Kunduz. Similar teams in other areas would follow. Initially ISAF was led by the United Kingdom, followed by Turkey and then jointly by German and the Netherlands. Canada assumed command of ISAF in February 2004.", "Name": "ATHENA", "Date": "14 May 2003 - Present", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " ISAF's primary role is to support the Government of Afghanistan (GOA) in providing and maintaining a secure environment in order to facilitate the re-building of Afghanistan", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada joined the campaign against terror and participated in Operation ENDURING FREEDOM under the Canadian Operation APOLLO, and it wished to maintain its presence in Afghanistan after the latter\u2019s termination. Accordingly, on 12 February 2003 the Minister of National Defence announced that Canada would participate in ISAF, operating in the southern and western sectors of Kabul that included both rural and urban districts as well as the \u201cArab\u201d quarter. Under the name Operation ATHENA, a two-thousand strong battle group would deploy beginning in August. The CDS operation order was issued on 14 May 2003, and shortly thereafter a Theatre Activation Team was despatched to set up the camp and the facilities required for the main contingent. The last member of the TAF returned to Canada on 8 August. The battle group formed around the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment, and subsequently the 3rd Battalion, Royal 22e R\u00e9giment, which deployed in January 2004. Each battle group included an armoured reconnaissance squadron, a health services support company, and engineers - all supported by a national control element and a national support element that included a 200-person base in the Arabian Gulf. The battle groups conducted a multitude of tasks. They patrolled the streets of Kabul in their area of responsibility, often with the Kabul City police, 3 R22R alone conducting over 3,800 patrols and manning over 880 checkpoints in six months. The Field Engineer Squadrons built explosives demolition ranges where they destroyed seized ammunition. In terms of humanitarian assistance, they rebuilt and repaired schools, orphanages, and public utilities, and helped secure the donation of much-needed equipment and supplies for these initiatives as well as for the Kabul police. Canada reduced its commitment to ISAF to seven hundred, all ranks, in August 2004 in order to provide the army with a pause from the high operational tempo. Instead of a full battle group, the next three rotations would be built around an armoured reconnaissance squadron and an infantry company, supported by a health services support company, and national control and national support elements. Some of the rotations also had an engineer squadron attached. The infantry companies provided a quick reaction force for ISAF, escorted convoys and conducted foot and mounted patrols in their sector of Kabul. The recce squadrons served as the Kabul Multinational Brigade's armoured reconnaissance squadron, providing intelligence-gathering and support observation to ISAF and conducting mounted patrols alone and in support of other ISAF forces. These operations netted both known terrorists and foreign nationals. Op ATHENA saw the introduction of new equipment into the Canadian Forces. Four Sperwer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles were bought and used to provide a reconnaissance capability. Over 1100 Mercedes Gelaende Class (G-Class) wagons were purchased to replace the older Volkswagen Iltis, one hundred of which were sent to Op Athena. The G-Wagons featured improved armoured protection against small arms fire, mines, and improvised explosive devices. Op ATHENA also saw the first major deployment of the LAV III armoured vehicle. The Nyala mine clearance vehicle also deployed on this operation. In addition, two explosive-sniffing dogs were acquired in mid-2005 to provide an explosives detection capability as a result of improvised explosive devices being found in Kabul. Canadian officers have held a number of senior appointments in ISAF. On 17 July 2003, Brigadier-General P.J. Devlin assumed command of the Kabul Multinational Brigade, the operational headquarters for ISAF. Major-General A. Leslie was Deputy Commander of ISAF for six months beginning in June 2003, while Lieutenant-General R. Hillier commanded ISAF from 9 February to 8 August 2004. Lieutenant-General Hillier\u2019s command coincided with the North Atlantic Council expanding ISAF\u2019s mandate in February 2004 to other parts of the country. The first Op ATHENA series officially ended on 18 October 2005 after a provincial reconstruction team in Kandahar stood up under the name Operation ARCHER and operated under the Campaign Against Terrorism rather than ISAF. The last Canadian assets were removed from Kabul\u2019s Camp Julien on 29 November and the camp was then turned over to the Afghan Ministry of Defence and to German forces. Overall, about 7,000 personnel served in this phase of Operation ATHENA. On 31 July 2006, ISAF assumed control of operations in six southern provinces of Afghanistan. These included the Canadian area of control around Kandahar. Accordingly, most of the personnel of Op ARCHER now came under a renewed Op ATHENA, as the mission had reverted to ISAF.

Like so many other armies before it, the Soviets become bogged down in a guerrilla war that they realized they could not win. The Afghan resistance - the mujahideen - received extensive support from the United States, as Afghanistan became another Cold War area of confrontation, in this case with Soviet forces actually involved in large numbers. From Afghanistan, military forces sometimes ventured into Pakistani territory, while large numbers of refugees headed into Pakistan. In the other direction, American support was funnelled through Pakistan, with the result that the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan accused each other of interference. As early as June 1982, indirect talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan began in Geneva, Switzerland. The government of Afghanistan acted as intermediary for the Soviet Union, the Soviet troops being there ostensibly to support a fellow socialist government. The growing casualty list and desire to extract itself from this costly adventure eventually prompted the Soviets to reach an agreement. The \u201cAgreement on the Settlement of the Situation Relating to Afghanistan\u201d was signed on 14 April 1988, by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and consisted of four instruments. Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed to not interfere in each other\u2019s nations, and on the return of refugees, while the Soviet Union and the United States agreed to provide the guarantee for the agreement. All parties agreed to seek a settlement of the situation in Afghanistan, effectively allowing the Soviet Union to withdraw. This latter part of the agreement requested the United Nations Secretary-General to provide a representative to assist in the conduct of the agreement. The United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) provided support to the Special Representative. Formal approval for this mission was not forthcoming until 31 October 1988, at which time the Security Council approved the Secretary-General\u2019s action through Resolution 622. The role of UNGOMAP was to monitor the provisions of the non-interference instrument, monitor the withdrawal of Soviet troops and monitor the return of refugees. To do this, the Special Representative was provided with 50 military observers from ten countries the nationalities of which had to be approved by the four parties to the agreement. Two headquarters of five officers each were created in Kabul and Islamabad. The remaining 40 officers were to be used on inspection teams. The first personnel arrived on 25 April, temporarily seconded from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. The permanent members arrived soon thereafter with the headquarters and complement of 50 observers in place well before the agreement came into effect on 15 May 1988. The monitoring of the Soviet withdrawal went very well. UNGOMAP established three observation posts in Afghanistan: Hayratan, Torghundi and the Soviet air base at Shindand. Mobile inspection teams deployed to five locations. Due to the fact that UNGOMAP was reliant upon the Soviet and Afghan forces for transportation, the observers were not always able to observe actual withdrawals and had to depend upon Soviet reports. However, as the Soviets were anxious to leave and the Afghans to cooperate, there were no significant problems with the withdrawal. This part of the agreement ended 15 February 1989, on schedule. To the headquarters in Islamabad fell the duty of monitoring the non-interference instrument. This was less successful than the withdrawal. From 1 May 1988 to 15 April 1989, 495 Notes Verbale cited 4145 incidents. Of these, 650 incidents were investigated; the remainder could not be investigated for a variety of reasons, including inaccessibility of the incident site. With the withdrawal of Soviet forces, Afghan reports of incidents increased, causing UNGOMAP to set up three monitoring posts on roads leading into Afghanistan. For the return of the refugees, UNGOMAP worked with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The observers were ready to monitor the conditions inside Afghanistan; however the Soviet withdrawal did not mean the end of violence - the mujahideen who had not been party to the agreement continued to fight the Soviet-backed government. Of the estimated 5 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, only a small percentage returned. UNMOGAP was originally scheduled to last until January 1990. Due to the late start of the refugee instrument, the Secretary-General requested an additional two months extension, which was approved by the Security Council. As no consensus could be reached with four parties to the agreement for an extension beyond 15 March 1990, UNMOGAP ceased to exist on that day. The Secretary-General, concerned of the work still to be done, created the Office of the Secretary-General in Afghanistan and Pakistan (OSGAP) as a follow-on mission.

Agreements were finally reached on a Soviet withdrawal in April 1988, at which time the United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) was created to oversee the Soviet withdrawal, assist the return of Afghan refugees, and facilitate a political settlement in Afghanistan. UNGOMAP terminated on 15 March 1990. The Secretary-General wished to continue the efforts at assisting the return of refugees and facilitating a political settlement. Accordingly, he requested and obtained the use of one military officer from each of the ten UNGOMAP contributory nations to assist the Secretary-General\u2019s personal representative. When UNGOMAP\u2019s mandate terminated on 15 March, the Secretary-General created the Office of the Secretary-General in Afghanistan and Pakistan (OSGAP) to continue the work. The position of Personal Representative was created in May 1989. He assisted in the Secretary-General\u2019s responsibilities towards implementing the Security Council\u2019s resolutions regarding Afghanistan. He also served as the Coordinator of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA). As the UN created new missions for Afghanistan, such as the UN Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA, 21 December 1993), the need for the Secretary-GeneraI\u2019s representative decreased. Accordingly, in December 1994, the Secretary-General terminated the function of the Personal Representative. In January 1995, the Secretary-General established the Office of the Secretary-General in Afghanistan (OSGA) to support UNSMA. OSGAP was terminated and its political role taken over by OSGA. The humanitarian role remained with UNOCHA. OSGAP maintained two offices, one in Islamabad, Pakistan, and one in Kabul, Afghanistan. A small sub-office was maintained in Peshawar, Pakistan until July 1992. The Military Advisory Unit was a special sub-section of OSGAP. Their original goal was to plan for a UN force, along the lines of the later International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), for a possible deployment to Afghanistan. They were also responsible for providing military expertise to the Personal Representative and continually assessing the security situation in Afghanistan. Because the situation never developed that would allow a UN force to deploy, the MAU focussed upon building relations in the Khyber Pass-Jalalabad-Kabul corridor in order to allow humanitarian aid to reach Kabul. An Irish lieutenant-colonel led the ten lieutenant-colonels from ten other countries. They operated from the two OSGAP headquarters in Kabul and Islamabad; however, with the deteriorating security situation in Kabul, the UN withdrew its personnel from that office in July 1992. In April 1992 President Mohammed Najibullah Ahmadzai (1986 -1992) resigned to allow a neutralist government to take power in a UN-brokered deal. Unable to leave the city, he took refuge in the UN headquarters in Kabul. Unhappily, the change in regime did not bring stability to the country and that led the UN to review its requirements for operations in Afghanistan. One of the decisions made was to close down the MAU and its operations ceased in January 1993. Canadian participation in OSGAP commenced with the termination of UNGOMAP and ended with the UN decision to terminate the MAU.

Copper mining on the island produced considerable wealth for the government of PNG; however, the mining also brought environmental damage and social change. Some elements on Bougainville believed the island's people would be better served being independent of Papua New Guinea. The Bougainville Revolutionary Army was formed to fight for independence, while the Bougainville Resistance Force fought to maintain Bougainville within PNG. In the ten years of fighting, the island's infrastructure was destroyed, people lived in fear, and the economy was devastated. In 1997 the New Zealand government succeeded in arranging a peace conference that led to the Burnham Declaration of Ceasefire. This was followed by The Lincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and Development of Bougainville, 23 January 1998, the Arawa Agreement Covering Implementation of the Ceasefire, 30 April 1998 and the Bougainville Peace Agreement, 30 August 2001. In December 1997 New Zealand deployed a Truce Monitoring Group. This was folded into the Peace Monitoring Group (PMG) that was established by the Lincoln Agreement. The PMG officially began operations on 1 May 1998 and consisted of military and civlian personnel from Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu. On 15 June 1998 in a letter to the Secretary-General, the United Nations Security Council authorized the United Nations Political Office in Bougainville (UNPOB).

After the Second World War, the Viet Minh supported the development of the KRF and its fight for Cambodian independence from France; however, these efforts were never as strong as those in southern Vietnam or those in Laos. In early 1954, the Viet Minh invaded Cambodia. The Geneva Agreement for Cambodia required the ICSC to monitor the demobilization and reintegration of the KRF into Cambodian society before the planned elections. The Royal Cambodian Government had undertaken to allow all citizens the right to participate, without discrimination - this included the KRF. The ICSC also had to monitor the withdrawal of all foreign forces, and the release of all prisoners of war and civilian detainees. They had to ensure that no new military bases or forces are developed, and finally to monitor violations of Cambodian territory. The reintegration process went very well in Cambodia, as did the withdrawal of all foreign forces. In fact, the Viet Minh began withdrawing from Cambodia even before the ICSC-Cambodia had begun to function, while the KRF had begun to leave their strongholds to be included in the proposed elections, either as voters or as candidates for election. South Vietnam withdrew its 2,500 troops, while French troops were gone by the end of October 1954, with the exception of a training mission and cadre that were permitted under the Geneva Agreement. There were even a small number of North Vietnamese troops who withdrew, although the Canadian members of the ICSC-Cambodia thought the numbers suspiciously small. The inspection teams were very well received by all parties, not being subject to the harassment and problems associated with the other two ICSC organizations. After the withdrawals, most of the ICSC operations were routine, but there still remained work to be done. The demobilized KRF feared reprisals from the Cambodian authorities; however, the ICSC was able to dissipate these fears. The ICSC noted violations of Cambodian territory by North and South Vietnamese forces, as well as some from Thailand. The number of these violations gradually reduced in the first two years. Although not part of their original mandate, ICSC-Cambodia monitored the election. The general election, held 11 September 1955, was deemed to be fair by the ICSC, although there was intimidation and some violence by the Cambodian military and police. Some KRF personnel were arrested prior to the election, the arrests being for crimes during the resistance period, for criticism of the agreement signed with the United States for Mutual Aid, and for insulting the Cambodian royal family. The ICSC recommended these KRF detainees be either released or granted leniency. The operations of ICSC-Cambodia were not, however, without problems, as Prince Sihanouk used it as a foil to advance his own political ambitions. The ICSC in Cambodia originally operated with five fixed teams and four mobile ones. With the success of the agreement and the election, these were reduced to four fixed and one mobile. This was further reduced in 1956 when the only remaining team was that in Phnom Penh. The main function of this team was to check for the entry of war materiel, but it was also used to investigate territorial violations and the build up of forces along the Cambodian border. With the outbreak of open war in Vietnam, the Viet Cong began to use Cambodia as a refuge from which to launch guerrilla attacks into South Vietnam. Prince Sihanouk, the leader of Cambodia, decided not to move against these communist forces, as he sensed that they would ultimately be victorious and, given his own precarious position of power, he did not want to incur their enmity. The ICSC therefore did not conduct any inspections or investigate reports of foreign troops on Cambodian soil. In March 1969, the United States began a secret bombing campaign against Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia. As the communist infiltration increased and as Cambodia\u2019s own communists increased in strength, Prince Sihanouk re-established diplomatic ties with the United States, broken in 1965. The US military presence in Cambodia began to build up.

Included in UNAMIC\u2019s mandate was the provision of mine awareness training. However, shortly after beginning operations it was quickly realized that there was an urgent need for a major de-mining effort. To this end the Security Council passed resolution 728(1992) which expanded the size of the UNAMIC mission from the original 200 personnel to 1090 with field engineers and logistic support personnel. In February 1992, with the passage of UNSCR 745(1992), the United Nations established the United Nations Transition Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). UNTAC began operations in mid March 1992 and continued the de-mining work begun by UNAMIC until the end of its mandate in September 1993. Realizing the importance of continuing the program, the de-mining effort was continued under the auspices of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre, a national (Cambodian) institution established in the closing days of UNTAC. To support the centre, a United Nations Development Programme was established to provide for international community support to CMAC, in the form of both financial contributions and military and civilian technical advisors. In February of 1994 Canada announced it would be contributing 12 CF members to CMAC, making it the largest single contributor at the time. From 1 March 1994 to 30 June 2000, anywhere from four to twelve CF personnel served with the CMAC at any one time.\n\nThe scale of the problem was enormous. After nearly twenty years of continuous war, Cambodia was left with a legacy of between 8 \u2013 10 million mines nation-wide. CMAC addresses the mine and unexploded ordnance problem through four main programme activities: 1) Mine/Unexploded ordinance awareness, 2) Minefield verification and marking, 3) Mine/UXO clearance, and 4) Training. By late 1996 CMAC was operating 48 de-mining platoons, each of 30 personnel, 18 mine marking teams, 15 Explosive Ordinance Disposal teams, four mine awareness teams, and a national training centre to train personnel. CMAC also controlled the efforts of some 20 additional demining platoons operated by non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and oversees any commercial mine/UXO clearance activities in Cambodia. At its peak in 1999, CMAC operated 70 demining platoons and 18 EOD teams nation wide.\n\nIn 1998, CMAC changed its emphasis from an emergency phase, to a developmental phase, in which the selection of minefields to be cleared was based on the requests from high casualty rate communities and an assessment of the socio-economic benefits.

During the war Vichy France was allowed to maintain symbolic control of the colony until its outright takeover by Japan on 9 March 1945. During the war, various indigenous groups fought the Japanese, the most prominent being the communist Viet Minh of Vietnam, led by Ho Chi Minh. They had first fought minor guerrilla actions against the French and later major actions against the Japanese in their effort to gain independence for the Vietnamese people. Indeed, when the war ended, it was the Viet Minh who assumed control of Vietnam. But with the support of Britain and the United States, French colonial authority was reasserted over all of Indochina, leading the Viet Minh, Pathet Lao (Laos) and Khmer Rouge (Cambodia) to renew their struggle for independence. Over time, public support for these colonial wars dwindled in France, and following the defeat of the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu in May 1954, the government of France was ready to negotiate its withdrawal from all of Indochina. The Geneva Agreements on the Cessation of Hostilities in Viet-nam, Laos and Cambodia, signed on 20 and 21 July 1954, were co-sponsored by Great Britain, and the Soviet Union and included China, France and the United States as well. Signing the agreements for the combatants were Cambodia, France, Laos, and the Viet Minh. There was no representative for the southern Vietnamese. The Geneva conference produced three separate agreements, one for each of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The agreements were similar in outline, but varied in detail, with different goals for each nation. Much to Canada\u2019s surprise, this nation was invited, at the suggestion of China, to be one of three nations whose representatives would ensure the agreements were followed, along with India and Poland. The headquarters for the three ISCS missions were situated in Hanoi, Vietnam; Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Vientiane, Laos respectively. From these headquarters, reports on progress or violations would be passed to the Geneva Agreements sponsors (Great Britain and the Soviet Union). Reports would also be passed to a Joint Commission of high-level French and North Vietnamese officials who were to decide on a course of action to correct any problems noted in the report, but due to differences between the objectives of the two nations the Joint Commission proved to be of little value. On the ground in each country there would be fixed and mobile teams to conduct inspections and investigate complaints.

Each was normally commanded by a Brigadier-General. The personnel sent to Indochina were sent on one-year tours, except for the military security guards for whom it was six months. Although they were posted to one of the ICSCs, specialist personnel could be moved and were moved on occasion from one ICSC to another. The officers, members of the fixed teams, did not normally move between ICSCs, although they could move between one fixed team and another within an ICSC.

Canadian members for the other ICSCs arrived in early September via Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) North Star aircraft from 426 Squadron. The RCAF sent a North Star every six months to transfer personnel in and out, later using a Yukon aircraft from 437 Squadron.

Concern for the safety of Canadian civilians and diplomats there led Ottawa to begin to plan for their evacuation from China. Under the name Operation ORIENT, Air Transport Command assumed responsibility for the task and, on 11 November 1948, advised 426 Squadron to standby to evacuate both Canadian and foreign nationals from the city. Cancelled on 16 November, ORIENT was revived on 24 November, again on a stand-by basis, until 1 December, when the Cabinet decided that it was more cost effective to charter a civilian aircraft. The Communist advance continued, however, and on 25 January 1949, after consulting with the Chief of the Naval Staff, the Government of Canada requested that a Canadian destroyer be diverted to China in case the two hundred Canadians in the Nanking area required evacuation. HMCS Crescent was chosen four days later. Following a personal briefing for her Captain in Ottawa, she left Esquimalt on 2 February and arrived in Chinese waters twenty-three days later and joined other Commonwealth warships on standby for similar operations. Alternating between conducting exercises with them and standing-by in Nanking as the duty ship should an evacuation begin, Crescent was in the city from 11-23 March and was to have sailed there again a second time.

Led by intellectuals, labour activists and students, these demonstrations were centred on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, but also occurred in other large cities such as Shanghai. Beginning in 1978, Deng Xiaoping had instituted a series of economic and political reforms that moved China to a market economy. Secretary General Hu Yaobang had been forced to resign on 16 January 1987 after his calls for more rapid reforms and other statements had been found unacceptable by the Chinese Communist Party (CPC). When he died of a heart attack on 15 April 1989, student activists saw this as the opportunity not only to mourn his passing but also to renew attention to the pro-democracy protests of 1986-87. The first gatherings in Tiananmen Square on 15 April were expressions of mourning; however, by 17 April large student crowds moved into the square and began drafting petitions with actions they wished the government to implement. By 21 April over 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square. Upset by what they believed was biased media reporting, the students began demanding freedom of the press and an end to or reform of the CPC\u2019s rule of China. Throughout May 1989, the protests grew but were peaceful. For the Chinese Government the protests presented a dilemma. The popular protests of 1976 that had led to the ousting of the \u201cGang of Four\u201d had received Government affirmation. Now a similar protest was underway. The CPC was also divided. General Secretary Zhao Ziyang favoured a softer approach to resolving the demonstrations while Premier Li Peng argued for a harder response. On 19 May Zhao spoke directly to the students at the Square; however, his appeal had little success and this was his last public appearance before being placed under house arrest. On 20 May the Government declared martial law. The 27th and 28th Armies were brought in from outside Beijing as the local army units were considered to be sympathetic to the protest. At 10:30 PM, 3 June the army began its assault on Tiananmen Square. By 5:40 AM the next morning, the Square was cleared. Perhaps the most memorable photograph of the events was that of an unknown protester standing alone in front of the tanks on 5 June. Who the man was and what became of him remain unknown. The number of casualties incurred during the assault on Tiananmen Square is also unknown.

After the Second World War, the Dutch portion was incorporated into Indonesia, as part of the Netherlands\u2019 decolonization process. Portuguese Timor remained a colony until 1975. In April 1974, the dictatorship of Marcello Caetano was overthrown in a peaceful revolution in Portugal. Fearing potential political instability in its neighbour, Indonesia became interested in Portuguese Timor. In late 1974, the Indonesian military launched Operation KOMODO, a covert operation to create the requisite conditions to enable Indonesia to incorporate East Timor. On 11 August 1975, Indonesian-backed forces staged a coup and took power from the Portuguese administration. Ignoring UN resolutions supporting the right of the East Timorese people to self-determination, Indonesia incorporated East Timor as its 27th province on 17 July 1976. Indonesian rule was repressive. While human rights abuses were reported, the international community took little notice. The East Timorese diaspora worked hard to overcome this, led by the Roman Catholic Church in East Timor. Within the country, resistance forces suffered from division through the 1980s, and from a lack of foreign support. In April 1998, Xanana Gusmao brought together the various nationalist and resistance forces into one organization, the National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT). A unified voice and increasing international attention helped bring the East Timor situation to the fore in the mid-1990s. In February 1997, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Jamsheed Marker, a diplomat from Pakistan, as his personal representative for East Timor. Progress was soon made in reaching a deal with the Indonesian government. The breakthrough occurred on 27 January 1999 when Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced he would support a referendum for East Timor. An agreement was signed between Indonesia, Portugal and the UN on 5 May, which created a timeline for a referendum on independence and specified that Indonesia would be responsible for providing security and maintaining the peace. The latter was Indonesia\u2019s precondition to moving forward with the vote. The Security Council approved Resolution 1246 on 11 June, creating the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) to supervise the referendum. All was not as peaceful as it seemed, however. The Indonesian military had been arming the Indonesian-backed East Timor militias as well as civilian volunteers. In part, this was a response to the continued guerrilla attacks from Falintil, the military arm of the CRNT. It was also an attempt to intimidate Timorese voters to not vote or to vote against independence. On 30 August 1999, over 98 percent of eligible voters participated in the referendum, over 78 percent voting for independence. The anti-independence militias took this as their signal to begin a systematic campaign of destruction and terror. Entire villages were destroyed, while all buildings in the East Timorese enclave of Oecussi (situated along the north coast of West Timor) were razed. Over 8000 were killed and entire populations displaced. The Indonesian authorities and the militias transported more than 250,000 people into West Timor, many against their will. UN estimates indicated that 750,000 people, out of a population of 880,000 were internally displaced or forced into West Timor. UNAMET personnel were also targeted, with most evacuating to Darwin, Australia. A UN special mission sent to East Timor concluded that Indonesia was responsible for the violence. Succumbing to international pressure, Indonesian President Habibie invited the UN on 12 September to send an international force to restore peace. Reacting quickly to the violence, the UN Security Council authorized one of the most strongly-worded mandates ever produced. Resolution 1264 of 15 September created the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) under Chapter VII, allowing it to use \u201call necessary measures\u201d. INTERFET had three roles: 1- to restore peace and security, 2- to protect and support UNAMET in carrying out its tasks and 3- to assist in humanitarian operations within force capabilities. While still in the planning stages, Australia had agreed to be the prime backer of INTERFET. The first INTERFET forces arrived in Dili, the capital of East Timor, on 20 September. By the end of the month more than 4,000 troops were deployed, with 8,200 by 1 November. INTERFET initially deployed to a few key locations, and then spread out its operations from each of these. The goal was to create areas of stability and then expand upon these until the entire country was covered. INTERFET quickly established a secure environment into which humanitarian aid could be flown. The troops gained access to remote and hard-to-reach areas, identifying the humanitarian needs in each. In many cases, it was INTERFET that provided the initial humanitarian aid as it deployed, to be followed by relief agencies. INTERFET also provided the initial response in rebuilding critical infrastructure, for instance rebuilding roads to allow humanitarian aid to move by truck instead of having to be air-dropped. INTERFET military medical teams also provided health services to the general population along with 16 other international organizations. Another INTERFET role was arrest and detention, but this was turned over to UN Civilian Police (UNCP) and the East Timorese judiciary in mid-January 2000. INTERFET forces also supported UNCP in restoring order after unrests in late December and early January. This included conducting increased patrols in Dili and Baucau after incidents there. With INTERFET effectively restoring order to East Timor, the UN recognized that a much larger operation than UNAMET was required to assist East Timor in becoming a functioning state. Accordingly, the Security Council approved a new plan on 25 October, creating the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). One of UNTAET\u2019s three components was a peacekeeping force (UN PKF). The UN PKF was required due to UN estimates of over 1000 hard-core militants still being present in West Timor. The transition from INTERFET to the UN PKF started on 1 February and was completed on the 23rd. Although similar in structure and combat capability, the UN PKF had a different mandate. Seventy percent of the INTERFET forces remained in East Timor and transitioned to the UN PKF.", "Name": "TOUCAN", "Date": "20 September 1999 - 23 February 2000", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " The Security Council authorized (S/RES/1264) the multinational force (INTERFET) under a unified command structure headed by Australia to restore peace and security in East Timor, to protect and support UNAMET in carrying out its tasks and, within force capabilities, to facilitate humanitarian assistance operations.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada\u2019s contribution to INTERFET began on 12 September when the Prime Minister announced that Canada would send up to 600 troops to support the Australian-led force. This caught the Canadian Forces by surprise, resulting in some scrambling to determine what type of contribution Canada could make. Minister of National Defence Art Eggleton indicated after a 14 September Cabinet meeting that the CF, although stretched because of other international commitments, would probably send a 250 person infantry company, two CC-130 Hercules transports and a replenishment ship. HMCS Protecteur departed Esquimalt on 23 September with a Sea King helicopter from 443 Squadron. The ship arrived off East Timor in late October, remaining in theatre until 26 January 2000. During this period, Protecteur served as a floating supply base for the coalition forces ashore and as an alternate command and control platform for the Canadian Joint Force Commander. The Sea King was employed in a transport role, carrying or slinging supplies ashore. The sailors aboard the ship also participated in several humanitarian projects, including the reconstruction of several schools. The two Hercules transport aircraft from 436 Squadron left Trenton on 20 September. One aircraft had repeated technical problems that prevented it from leaving Canada for a week. The resulting media frenzy suggested that the Hercules were too old for this type of mission. The tactical airlift detachment arrived in Townsville, Australia on the 21st, arriving after a CC-150 Polaris flight of 28 hours. Once accommodations were available in Darwin, the 103 members of the tactical airlift detachment moved to the Royal Australian Air Force facility at that location. A recce party departed for East Timor on 25 September, with the advance party arriving two days later. The first mission was flown on the 28th. From Darwin and Townsville, the Hercules flew into the East Timorese cities of Dili, Baucau and Suai. Despite the initial problems getting to East Timor, the Hercules performed flawlessly once in theatre. A three-crew maintenance schedule allowed 24-hour seven days a week maintenance to be carried out on the aircraft, and as with any coalition operation there was mutual support and the sharing of parts and expertise between the various nations. On 6 December the aircraft and detachment returned to Canada. Over the course of operation, they flew 130 missions, carrying 2100 passengers and more than 1000 tons of supplies. A further air force contribution was made in the form of monthly CC-150 Polaris resupply flights. These brought parts, mail and other materiel required by the Canadian contingent. The construction engineering contingent and the soldiers of the Royal 22e Regiment all flew over on these flights. Because of the wholesale destruction of buildings in East Timor, a construction element was required to build facilities for the Canadians ashore. A Works and Design Squadron was created from elements of 1 Engineering Support Unit, Naval Construction Team (Pacific) supported by some personnel from NCT (Atlantic) and Fleet Construction Engineering Office Halifax. The lead element departed for Darwin on 14 October, followed by the main party on 24 October. They began construction of the Canadian camp at Zumalai on 6 November, finishing on 13 December. Construction of the accommodations had to be quickly completed before the onset of the monsoon season. This required an elevated building that was well-sealed to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Some personnel remained in Darwin to coordinate the procurement and delivery of construction materiel to East Timor. The 3e bataillon, Royal 22e Regiment provided a 250-man contingent to Op Toucan. They arrived in Australia on 15 October, where they conducted training with the 1st Battalion Royal New Zealand Regiment to whom they would be attached. They landed near the town of Suai on 28 October after being transported by the Australian assault ship HMAS Tobruk. The main role of the soldiers was to patrol a large territory from Ainaro in the east to Suai in the west. In addition to their regular patrols, the Vandoos also repaired a school and hospital in Zumalai, distributed basic sanitation needs, clothing and containers, and taught some English. When INTERFET personnel were transferred to UNTAET, the Vandoos became the only Canadian contribution to INTERFET that made the transition, as all the other units had departed by this time."}}, {"opName": "(Guam 1975)", "countryRegion": "Guam", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1975-05-04", "endDate": "1975-05-07", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/guam-1975.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Guam 1975", "International Mission Name": "Guam 1975", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "Guam", "Mission Date": "4 May 1975 - 7 May 1975", "Mission Mandate": " To fly from Guam, Vietnamese refugees boat people accepted for entry into Canada", "Mission/Operation Notes": " With the fall of South Vietnam in April 1975, refugees by the thousands fled the country.

This aircraft number 44-50154 named Reluctant Dragon by the Indian Air Force was manufactured at the Ford Motor Company plan at Willow Run, Michigan and was delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF) on the Lend-Lease program. Initially the aircraft was abandoned at the end of the war by the RAF, but then restored by the IAF for use in maritime patrols.

With no de-icing equipment or radar and limited navigation equipment, the Liberator required the escort.

Under the terms of the partition, the 562 independent princely states, including the state of Jammu and Kashmir (commonly known as Kashmir), were free to choose association with either India or Pakistan, a choice usually dictated by the majority religion in the state. In Kashmir, however, while three-quarters of the population was Muslim, the maharaja was Hindu, and his delay in making a choice between India or Pakistan not only provoked internal sectarian violence but Muslim Pathan tribesmen also invaded from what was to become Pakistani territory. Eventually, on 22 October 1947, the Indian Army moved forward to thwart the Pathan advance, an intervention which, in turn, drew the Pakistani Army into the conflict. On 31 December 1947 India asked the United Nations to intervene. On 20 January 1948, Security Council Resolution 39 created the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), but when both parties objected to its planned composition a second Resolution (47) had to be proposed. It was agreed to by the Security Council on 21 April 1948, was acceptable to both parties and the first members of UNCIP arrived in the region on 7 July. By 13 August they had worked out a process to implement and observe a cease-fire, a proposal that was ultimately accepted and brought into force by India and Pakistan on 1 January 1949. The first seven observers arrived three weeks later, and most of the rest \u2013 UNCIP\u2019s strength would peak at thirty-four \u2013 were in place by the end of February. This deployment was made with the consent of the two parties and was based on strict principles of impartiality and non-interference. The job of UNCIP was to observe and report, not to interpose itself between the Indian and Pakistani armies to actively prevent conflict and in so doing UNCIP helped establish precisely what the cease-fire line was along the entire Indian-Pakistani frontier. On 18 July 1949 the Karachi Agreement decreed that the cease-fire line would be the Line of Control, along which UNCIP would station observers as it deemed necessary in order to observe and report and, in company with local Pakistani and Indian commanders, investigate alleged breaches. On 14 March 1950, with the cease-fire holding along the Line of Control, the Security Council passed Resolution 90, which terminated UNCIP and instead appointed a UN Special Representative to assist the two nations in demilitarizing Kashmir as a prelude to finding a permanent solution to the territorial dispute there: both sides continued to argue that they should own territory on the \u201cother\u201d side of the Line of Control. But observers would remain \u2013 now as an independent organization, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). Canada was asked to contribute to UNCIP on 10 December 1948; the government agreed; and four were dispatched to Kashmir in February 1949. The commitment doubled to eight in June, and all were transferred to UNMOGIP when it was established. A Canadian, Brigadier H.H. Angle, was appointed UNCIP\u2019s Chief Military Observer in November 1949, and he was holding that post when he was killed in a plane crash in Kashmir on 17 July 1950.\u00a0"}}, {"opName": "United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan", "countryRegion": "India and Pakistan", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1950-06-25", "endDate": "2019-02-23", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/united-nations-military-observer-group-india-pakistan.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "India and Pakistan", "Mission Date": "25 June 1950 - Present", "Mission Mandate": " The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was created on 14 March 1950 to supervise the cease-fire between India and Pakistan in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " In August 1947, India and Pakistan gained their independence from Great Britain. The state of Jammu and Kashmir (commonly known as Kashmir) became a point of conflict between the two nations, over which they went to war. The United Nations created the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), which subsequently assisted in creating a cease-fire. Attached to UNCIP were military observers, who reported to UNCIP\u2019s Senior Military Advisor. When UNCIP was dissolved on 14 March 1950, the Security Council resolution kept the military observers in place, who thereupon became the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). The strength of UNMOGIP has fluctuated according to the level of tension in the area, ranging from a low of thirty-six in 1950 to a high of sixty-seven in 1964, one year before fighting broke out again. In 2005 it comprised forty-six observers, none of whom was Canadian. From the outset, UNMOGIP\u2019s observers were posted on both sides of the Line of Control, the name given to the cease-fire line agreed to in 1949, and their task is to observe and report on compliance with that agreement. Forbidden from intervening, their presence did not prevent the outbreak of war between India and Pakistan in 1965 or again in 1971. India\u2019s success in the latter war changed the location of Line of Control, and led India to argue that UNMOGIP\u2019s mandate had now lapsed, but despite the fact that the original UN intervention was based on the principle of consensus, the Secretary General ruled that only the UN Security Council could terminate UNMOGIP, which it has yet to do.", "Name": "United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan", "Date": "1 July 1950 - 30 November 1995", "Canadian Task Force Name Abbreviation": "UNMOGIP", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada contributed eight of UNMOGIP\u2019s original thirty-four observers - on a one-year posting involving six months on each side of the Line of Control. A ninth was added in 1955. Nine years later the UN asked Canada to provide air transport as well, and the RCAF despatched one DHC-4 Caribou, three officers, and five ground crew from No 102 Composite Squadron (102 KU) in Trenton. They came under fire in the 1965 war, and the Caribou was severely damaged in a strafing attack by a Pakistani Air Force Sabre, but fortunately there were no casualties to personnel. With the cease-fire, the personnel of 102 KU were temporarily attached to 117 Air Transport Unit (117 ATU) from September 1965 to March 1966. Here they supported both UNMOGIP and United Nations India-Pakistan Observer Mission (UNIPOM) air requirements. With the end of UNIPOM\u2019s mandate, the personnel of 102 KU returned to their normal duties in support of UNMOGIP. They also officially became a unit of the Royal Canadian Air Force, 102 Composite Unit Detachment. On 8 July 1968, 102 KU was renamed 424 Squadron and soon afterwards the first Twin Otter arrived to replace the Caribou. This aircraft did not serve long, however, as it was destroyed on the ground at Rawalpindi four months later, following the outbreak of the 1971 India-Pakistan War. On 1 April 1975, the 424 Squadron UNMOGIP Detachment was officially disbanded, and all personnel had left by the end of March. Canada\u2019s permanent contribution was now reduced to the original number of nine military observers. This was reduced to one by the end of 1978 and eliminated altogether in early 1979. Since then, Canada\u2019s contribution to UNMOGIP has been transient and transitory in nature. CC-130 Hercules aircraft from Nos 435 and 436 Transport Squadrons routinely moved UNMOGIP headquarters from Rawalpindi to Srinagar and back again, but these missions lasted no more than a few weeks each time and they ceased in 1996 when UNMOGIP decided that it would be more cost-effective to move by truck. As it happened, therefore, the last Hercules flight prior to this decision - that undertaken in October 1995 - became Canada\u2019s last concrete contribution to UNMOGIP, bringing an end to a thirty-six year commitment involving over 350 Canadian military personnel."}}, {"opName": "(India - Pakistan 1965)", "countryRegion": "India and Pakistan", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1965-09-10", "endDate": "1965-09-28", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/india-pakistan-1965.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "India - Pakistan 1965", "International Mission Name": "India - Pakistan 1965", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "India and Pakistan", "Mission Date": "10 September 1965 - 28 September 1965", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " To evacuate Canadian citizens out of India and Pakistan during the 1965 War", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " In April 1965 Indian and Pakistani border patrols skirmished in disputed territory in the Rann of Kutch, along the southernmost point of India\u2019s western border with Pakistan. From here, the skirmishing spread into the disputed territory of Kashmir in August. On 14 August, the first engagement between the regular forces of both nations occurred in Kashmir. After a prolonged artillery barrage the next day, India captured three strategic mountain positions. Open conflict broke out along the whole border on 1 September when Pakistani forces attacked into the Punjab. This caught India unprepared. Both countries now began to launch air strikes, which placed the civilian population at increasing risk. Over the next weeks, a stalemate developed. The UN Security Council unanimously passed a resolution on 20 September calling for a cease-fire. India accepted the resolution the next day, while Pakistan accepted it on 22 September. The Soviet Union sponsored peace talks that led to the Tashkent Declaration on 10 January 1966. This formally ended the war. While the initial fighting was restricted mainly to Kashmir, the Canadian government expressed its concern and called for a cease-fire between the two parties. When the war escalated to most of the western border the Canadian government became increasingly concerned about the safety of its citizens in India and Pakistan and a potential humanitarian problem. On 10 September, 436 Squadron was put on standby to carry medical supplies to India and evacuate Canadian nationals from the country. Two 436 Squadron Hercules were prepared at Trenton and were ready for departure for Pakistan as well on 28 September.

An inconclusive war between the two had been fought over the Jammu-Kashmir region in 1947-1948, leading to the creation of the United Nations Military Observer Group India-Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to monitor the cease-fire and line of control there. Fighting broke out again in the Rann of Kutch region, at the southernmost point of the India-Pakistan border, in April 1965, and although an unofficial cease-fire was formalised on 30 June, it did not take root. By 5 August Pakistan had moved some 26,000 soldiers into Kashmir, and the fighting there continued all that month. On 1 September Pakistan opened a second front in the Punjab, south of Kashmir, and the fighting now escalated. That led the United Nations Security Council to begin calling for a cease-fire. Backed by the halting of arms shipments to the belligerents by Great Britain and the United States as well as by a Chinese ultimatum, the UN initiative gained momentum until, on 20 September, the Security Council passed Resolution 211, calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of all armed forces back to the positions they held prior to 5 August 1965. It also requested that the Secretary-General provide the necessary assistance to supervise the cease-fire and withdrawal of troops. As the mandate of UNMOGIP was limited to Kashmir, a separate United Nations India-Pakistan Observer Mission was created to monitor the cease-fire in the rest of the border region. India accepted the cease-fire on 21 September, Pakistan on the 22nd. UNIPOM was initially under the charge of UNMOGIP; however, with the arrival of Canadian Major-General B.F. Macdonald in October 1965 as force commander, UNIPOM began to operate independently, although still in close coordination with UNMOGIP. UNIPOM was initially created with fifteen military observers temporarily seconded from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization and twelve from UNMOGIP. With the arrival of the first of ninety-six observers, these augmentees were withdrawn. The immediate period after the cease-fire was characterized by continued skirmishes as neither side was prepared to produce a withdrawal plan at the negotiating table or enforce cease-fire discipline on their own troops. UNIPOM observers were therefore placed in the difficult position of attempting to enforce a cease-fire which they had no means of enforcing. The Tashkent Agreement, reached with the assistance of the Soviet Union and signed on 10 January 1966, called for the withdrawal of all forces to be completed by 25 February 1966. Thereafter, UNIPOM\u2019s personnel were able to effectively conduct their roles. Canada\u2019s contribution to UNIPOM consisted of the force commander, twelve army officers as observers, a Royal Canadian Air Force detachment, as well as the three officers and five airmen of the RCAF detachment with UNMOGIP, who were temporarily seconded to UNIPOM. That brought its total strength to ninety, a number subsequently reduced to seventy-nine by December. The RCAF detachment, designated 117 Air Transport Unit (ATU) was equipped with two DHC-4 Caribou and three DHC-2 Otter aircraft. The Caribous left Trenton on 24 September, arriving in Lahore, Pakistan after an eleven-day ferry flight. The Otters were dismantled and flown over in 436 Transport Squadron Hercules. The Canadian observers and the 117 ATU personnel flew to Lahore, Pakistan on a 437 Squadron Yukon aircraft.The Caribou were soon busy ferrying UNIPOM personnel to isolated desert posts and keeping them supplied. They also supported UNMOGIP\u2019s air requirements, including the semi-annual move in October of UNMOGIP\u2019s headquarters between Srinagar and Rawalpindi. The Otters, meanwhile, conducted reconnaissance missions over the desert on a nearly daily basis, flew twice-weekly ferry flights into the mountains, and carried observers on an on-call basis to reported hot-spots. For their part, the Canadian Army personnel were employed mainly at outposts on the India-Pakistani frontier, most of which was desert. Here they were responsible for patrolling the front lines and for responding to any cease-fire violations. Initially, UNIPOM was given a three-month mandate; however, by December 1965 India and Pakistan indicated they would like it to remain longer. A further three months was granted. However, with talks progressing well, UNIPOM\u2019s mandate was allowed to lapse on 22 March 1966. Most Canadians had left by then.

When efforts to create a new, independent, and unified Korean nation-state foundered, the United States turned to the United Nations for assistance. On 14 November 1947, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 112 (II), which created the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK), whose mandate was to supervise free and open elections, assist in the withdrawal of the occupying forces, and guide the new political entity to full independence. Canada was nominated by the United States to serve as a member of the nine-nation commission. Forbidden by the Soviets from entering their zone in the north, UNTCOK could not carry out its mandate and subsequently recommended that elections be held in the American-occupied south and that the winner there be recognized as the sole legitimate Korean government. In Resolution 195 (III), the General Assembly accepted UNTCOK\u2019s recommendations and created the United Nations Commission on Korea (UNCOK). Its mission was to expedite the withdrawal of occupying forces and to assist the new government in unifying the country and removing economic, social and other barriers. UNCOK was able to assist in the departure of the occupying forces, but had little success when it came to furthering Korean unification and, indeed, on 9 September 1948 North Korea declared its own separate nationhood. As a result the General Assembly changed UNCOK\u2019s mandate via Resolution 293 (IV) of 21 October 1949, adding the task of observing and reporting on any developments \u201cwhich might lead to or otherwise involve military conflict in Korea\u201d. In time, this became UNCOK\u2019s primary role, and it was two Australian military observers who first reported the North Korean invasion of the south on 25 June 1950. It was their report that led the UN Security Council to authorize the use of force to beat back the North Korean forces. Despite the outbreak of fighting, UNCOK remained in existence and its task continued to be to submit reports, observe the mandated North Korean withdrawal, and to keep the Security Council informed of the progress of its resolution. UNCOK was officially terminated on 7 October 1950 when the General Assembly created the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea (UNCURK). Canada was asked to provide two officers to UNCOK and did so despite the outbreak of war. They arrived on 25 July 1950 and commenced reporting on the situation on the ground. They were transferred to UNCURK when that mission stood up and continued their reports.\u00a0"}}, {"opName": "(United Nations Military Operations in Korea)", "countryRegion": "Korea", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1950-06-25", "endDate": "2019-02-23", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/united-nations-military-operations-korea.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Military Operations in Korea", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Military Operations in Korea", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "Korea", "Mission Date": "25 June 1950 - Ongoing", "Canadian Operation": " No Canadian Operation Name 30 June 1950 \u2013 1 August 1957", "Mandate": " To repel the North Korean aggressors UN Security Council Resolutions 82 (25 June 1950), 83 (27 June 1950), 84 (7 July 1950) and 85 (31 July 1950) (Chapter VII)", "Mission Notes": " On 25 June 1950, North Korean military forces crossed the 38th parallel, invading South Korea in an effort to create a single unified Korean state. International reaction was swift. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolutions 82 (25 June 1950), 83 (27 June 1950), 84 (7 July 1950) and 85 (31 July 1950), which called upon North Korea to withdraw its forces north of the 38th parallel. United Nations members were requested to provide such assistance as would allow South Korea to expel the northern aggressors. Further, a unified United Nations Command (UNC) was formed of the military forces sent to assist South Korea, the UN forces to be led by the United States. In Canada, the Cabinet met on 28 June to discuss possible Canadian responses to the Security Council requests. Lester Pearson, Secretary of State for External Affairs, indicated that the United States was reacting with more air and naval forces and that Great Britain was considering the contribution of a naval force. In addition, Pearson noted that the UN Secretary-General had requested two military officers several weeks previously, the officers to be employed with the United Nations Commission on Korea (UNCOK). Brooke Claxton, Minister of National Defence, indicated that Canada could contribute a number of destroyers and a small squadron of transport aircraft. All decisions on contributions were held off until all possibilities had been explored, although the two officers for UNCOK were approved (see entry for UNCOK and UNCURK).\u00a0\n\nOf the three military services, the Royal Canadian Navy was the only one in a position to provide a force for immediate deployment. On 30 June, three destroyers based on the west coast were ordered to sail for Pearl Harbor and onwards to Korea. It was only while in Pearl Harbor that HMCS Cayuga, Sioux and Athabaskan were advised that they would be under the operational control of General Douglas MacArthur as Commander United Nations Forces Korea. They arrived in Sasebo, Japan on 30 July, ready to join the defence of the Pusan (Busan) perimeter.\u00a0\n\nOn 19 July, Cabinet approved the deployment of 426 Squadron, the RCAF\u2019s only long-range transport squadron. 426 would be deployed under the operational command of the United States\u2019 Military Air Transport Service, under the name Operation HAWK. They departed Montreal on 25 July, arrived at McChord Air Force Base, Washington state on the 26th and sent three aircraft to Japan on the 27th.\u00a0\n\nThe question of sending ground troops was more problematic. There was an air of uncertainty as to whether the North Korean actions were an isolated incident, or whether the Soviet Union would use the apparent military weakness of the west to its own advantage. Canada had only one army formation that could be dispatched immediately \u2013 the Mobile Striking Force, which was tasked with the defence of Canada. To send this force would be to leave Canada without a ready response in case the Soviet Union challenged the newly-created NATO. Cabinet considered options through July about what type of ground contribution could be made, what equipment would be used (American or British), to whom would the force be attached. On 7 August, Cabinet agreed to send ground troops to Korea.\u00a0\n\nWith the arrival of the RCAF and RCN in Japan in late July 1950, it would be another seven years before the last Canadian forces would be withdrawn from Korea. Eight Canadian destroyers participated in the Korean Conflict, with all ships participating at least twice. It is beyond the scope of this description to provide a complete list of activities or a history of the RCN participation in Korea. During their initial deployment, Cayuga, Sioux and Athabaskan were deployed on the West Coast of Korea, under British command. They served as convoy and carrier escorts, participated in the Inchon landing as escorts for the logistics support group, attacked shore targets and protected friendly islands from sneak attacks. In addition they mounted anti-submarine patrols and from time to time landed and participated in several landings of South Korean Marines on more isolated off-shore islands. The occasional mine was detected and blown up by sending a motor cutter to attach explosives \u2013 a risky proposition. Aside from the risk from mines, perhaps the most dangerous part of the first patrol was the evacuation of UN forces from Chinnampo, the port for the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. Cayuga, Athabaskan, and several other allied vessels proceed up Taedong River, with its many shifting sandbars and undredged channels, and evacuated UN forces, bombarded targets ashore and escorted back numerous small craft filled with Korean refugees.\u00a0\n\nRCN vessels also operated on the East Coast of Korea with the USN. Here, the activities were similar to those on the West Coast, but with one addition. The East Coast of Korea is mountainous, but has a narrow coastal plain. Railway lines run along the coast, often in plain sight of ships at sea, and here, the UN destroyers were materially able to contribute to the war effort by attacking trains running along the coast. Those ships who could prove they had destroyed at least one train were able to join the \u201cTrainbusters Club\u201d. The RCN vessels took to the effort with a vengeance, destroying more trains than any other navy.\u00a0\n\nBy the time of the Armistice, eight RCN destroyers had participated in the conflict: HMCSs Athabaskan \u2013 3 deployments; Cayuga \u2013 2 deployment; Crusader \u2013 1 deployment; Haida \u2013 1 deployment; Huron \u2013 2 deployments; Iroquois \u2013 2 deployments; Nootka \u2013 2 deployments and Sioux \u2013 2 deployments. The RCAF contributed one transport squadron to the United Nations effort, and 22 fighter pilots on exchange with the USAF. The main thrust of RCAF activities in the period of the Korean War was to build up its own forces and deploy them to Europe, providing support to NATO at a time when a large portion of USAF resources were engulfed in Korea and when the Soviet union could have taken advantage of perceived NATO weaknesses.\u00a0\n\nDuring the Korean War, 426 Squadron served with the USAF in transporting personnel and supplies to the Korean theatre. These operations are described in the entry under Operation HAWK.\u00a0\n\nIn March 1951, the USAF suggested that RCAF pilots would benefit from exchanges with USAF squadrons in the Korean theatre. Canada accepted the offer as a way of giving RCAF pilots combat experience and a programme was instituted to post them, on an individual basis, to either the 18th Interceptor Wing at Kimpo just west of Seoul, or the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing at Suwon, south of Seoul. Their tour of duty would be six months or 50 combat missions, whichever came first; most found that they flew the requisite sorties in three to four months, accumulating about 70 hours of combat flying time, and 20 hours non-combat.\u00a0\n\nThe first pilot dispatched under this programme was Flying Officer B. Simpson, but he was not the first Canadian to see combat in Korea, as Flight Lieutenant Omer Levesque had already been on exchange with the USAF when war broke out in Korea and proceeded there with his American squadron.\nThe two squadrons undertook a myriad of roles: fighter sweeps and patrols behind enemy lines; combat air patrols covering the search and rescue of downed pilots; fighter bomber missions; and escorting photo reconnaissance aircraft.\u00a0\n\nOverall, RCAF pilots scored nine \u201ckills\u201d, two \u201cprobables\u201d and 10 \u201cdamaged\u201d. One pilot, Squadron Leader Andrew MacKenzie, was taken prisoner when his aircraft was accidentally shot down by one of his squadron mates. He was not released until 1955.\u00a0\n\nThe RCAF also contributed other personnel. Thirteen RCAF Nursing Sisters flew with the USAF Military Air Transport Service, bringing wounded soldiers from Korea to the United States and Canada. Occasionally, they flew on 426 Squadron flights. The RCAF also sent, on an individual basis, technical experts in a variety of trades for brief periods of time. When Canada decided to contribute land forces to the conflict the government chose to do so by mobilizing a volunteer \u201cspecial service force\u201d drawn largely from veterans of the Second World War. These became the 2nd Batallions of the three regular army infantry regiments (The Royal Canadian Regiment, the Princess Patricia\u2019s Canadian Light Infantry and the Royal 22nd Regiment), supported initially by C Squadron, Lord Strathcona\u2019s Horse (Royal Canadians) (2nd Armoured Regiment); 2nd Field Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery; 57th Canadian Independent Field squadron (Royal Canadian Engineers), and the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade Signals Squadron. First to arrive were 2nd Battalion PPCLI, in mid-February 1951, the rest of what would be called 25 Brigade following in May. The Brigade served under American command until the creation of the 1st Commonwealth Division.\u00a0\n\nVolunteers for the Special Service Force signed on for one-year. Accordingly, beginning in 1952, the original Special Service units and sub-units were replaced by the \u201cregular\u201d \u201cfirst battalions\u201d of the three infantry regiments and regular armoured, engineer and signal squadrons. All the other component corps of the army \u2013 medical, service, dental, ordnance, provost and RCEME - were of course represented in the theatre as well. The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, it should be added, provided pilots for aerial surveillance and spotting duties. A third rotation took place one year later.\u00a0\n\nAlthough there was a dramatic ebb and flow to the Korean conflict in its early months, the front line had essentially stabilized by the time most Canadians who served there had arrived. Further, patrolling and holding the line were the norm, not major offensive operations. But that did not diminish their contribution. Indeed, at Kapyong and Hill 355, the steadfastness of the Canadian units against overwhelming Chinese forces was remarkable, and the allied line did not break. The Headquarters, 25 Canadian Infantry Brigade (25 CIB) was formed on 9 August 1950. It arrived in Korea on 4 May 1951 and left 2 December 1954 with the reduction of the Canadian contribution. A Canadian Section, Headquarters First (Commonwealth) Division was formed on 1 August 1951 and disbanded 20 May 1956. Canadian personnel attached to division headquarters, which included the position of GSO 1, the division\u2019s principal staff officer, usually numbered from 20 to 30, and were responsible for planning within the 1st Commonwealth Division.\u00a0\n\nA Canadian Military Mission, Far East (CMMFE) was created in September 1950 to provide Canadian representation at the United Nations Forces (UNF) Headquarters in Tokyo. The Commander CMMFE responsibilities included making the preparation for the arrival of Canadian ground troops in theatre, advising the Canadian Chiefs of Staff on the general battle situation and on future United Nations Forces plans, and acting as a channel to convey information between Canada and the UNF. In these duties, he was responsible to the Commander, 25 Canadian Infantry Brigade.\u00a0\n\nWhile the bulk of Canadian personnel served in Korea, smaller numbers served in Japan, in support of the effort in Korea. These were mainly administrative units, and included an ordnance liaison group, a postal unit and signal troop. In June 1951 with the formation of the 1st Commonwealth Division, a Canadian contribution was made to the Commonwealth Hospital. The largest unit was the 25th Canadian Reinforcement Group, which was responsible for the holding and training of reinforcements until they were needed in Korea. All of these units were located at Kure, on the southwestern coast of the main island of Honshu.\u00a0\n\nIn October 1951, it was decided to reorganize and streamline the Canadian forces involved in supplying the troops in Korea. The Canadian Section, Line of Communications and Base Troops, British Commonwealth Forces in Korea was created. To it were later added a convalescent centre, a leave unit and a welfare adjunct. Fighting in Korea came to an end on 27 July 1953, but the signing of the armistice on that date did not end the Canadian role in Korea. The armistice agreement was not signed by the governments involved in the United Nations\u2019 efforts, but rather by the Commander, United Nations Command. As a result, it was the United Nations that acceded to the cease-fire and the military contribution that continued after the armistice was in support of the UN Command. There was considerable doubt as to whether either President Syngman Rhee of South Korea or the Chinese/North Korean forces would honour the armistice. The requirement to maintain forces in Korea therefore continued.\nAs a result, the RCAF continued Operation Hawk until 25 May 1954. Several fighter pilots also served on exchange with USAF forces in Korea. The RCN maintained three ships on station in Korean waters throughout 1954. It was not until 26 December 1954 that this was reduced to one ship. The RCN contribution was eliminated on 7 September 1955.\u00a0\n\nAfter the armistice, the First Commonwealth Division continued as a formation in Korea, although it later shifted its headquarters to Tokyo under the name British Commonwealth Forces, Korea (BCFK). The Division was disbanded in November 1954, although the title continued until March 1956. Canada continued to participate in the Commonwealth contingent, although there was no formal agreement.\u00a0\n\nThe Canadian brigade did not reduce its strength until November 1954 when most of its units returned to Canada. The 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade Headquarters was disbanded in December 1954. These reductions were carried out in consultation with Commonwealth governments and the United Nations Command. Remaining in Korea were the 2nd Battalion, The Queen\u2019s Own Rifles of Canada, No. 3 Field Ambulance, a provost detachment and three other minor units. Most of these were withdrawn in April 1955, leaving the total Canadian commitment at 20 officers and 260 men with the field forces in Korea and the headquarters in Japan. Further reductions in the UN would follow as the armistice seemed to hold. In March 1956, No. 3 Field Ambulance (RCAMC) departed to be replaced by the newly formed Canadian Medical Detachment composed of both medical and dental personnel. The CMMFE would also remain in Tokyo for a total Canadian contingent of 42 persons.\u00a0\n\nThis arrangement was to last a little over one year. The last Canadian troops were pulled out of Korea and Japan in August 1957, leaving only one Canadian Officer and one Canadian NCM with the UNC.\n"}}, {"opName": "HAWK", "countryRegion": "Korea", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1950-07-25", "endDate": "2019-02-23", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/hawk.html", "details": {"Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "Korea", "Mission Date": "25 July 1950 - Ongoing", "Mission Mandate": " To provide airlift support to United Nations Command, as requested through United Nations Security Council Resolutions 82 (25 June 1950), 83 (27 June 1950), and 84 (7 July 1950)", "Name": "Operation HAWK", "Date": "25 July 1950 - 25 May 1954", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " On 25 June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea in an effort to unify the country. The United Nations Security Council passed a series of resolutions that called upon North Korea to withdraw its forces north of the 38th parallel. More significantly, the Security Council requested UN members to provide such assistance to South Korea as would allow that country to repel the northern aggressors. The Security Council created a unified command of United Nations forces and requested the United States to lead these forces. In Canada, the Cabinet met on 28 June to discuss possible Canadian responses to the Security Council requests. Lester Pearson, Secretary of State for External Affairs, indicated that the United States was reacting with more air and naval forces and that Great Britain was considering the contribution of a naval force. In addition, Pearson noted that the UN Secretary-General had requested two military officers several weeks previously, the officers to be employed with the United Nations Commission on Korea (UNCOK). Brooke Claxton, Minister of National Defence, indicated that Canada could contribute a number of destroyers and a small squadron of transport aircraft. All decisions on contributions were held off until all possibilities had been explored, although the two officers for UNCOK were approved.\u00a0\n\nAfter consultations with the United States, it was determined that for the Air Force contribution, a squadron of transport aircraft would be the most valuable because the United States\u2019 Military Air Transport Service (MATS) had a greatly reduced capability at that time. After the effort of the Berlin Airlift, a large proportion of MATS\u2019 aircraft were undergoing extended maintenance and cleaning. Accordingly, the Cabinet approved the deployment of 426 Squadron on 19 July 1950, under the name of Operation HAWK.\n\nAs it was, 426 Squadron had already begun making its own preparations for a possible deployment. As the RCAF\u2019s only long-range transport squadron, they expected to be called upon to provide support to any Canadian contribution to the United Nations\u2019 efforts. 426 Squadron\u2019s planning included the use of six Canadair North Star aircraft, flying from one of the Northwest states in the United States for a period of one year. In this planning, the squadron was helped by the fact they had completed Operation Mobility in the past year, which saw them quickly deploy to Edmonton and operate from that location over several months.\n\nOn 20 July, 426 Squadron was ordered to deploy to McChord Air Force Base, Washington State, to be integrated into the United States MATS\u2019 efforts. Six aircraft would initially deploy, transporting personnel and materiel to Japan, with the caveat that the aircraft were not to fly to South Korea. Five days later, six North Stars departed for McChord, arriving on the 26th. On the 27th, the three aircraft departed for Japan.\u00a0\n\nOperations from McChord proved difficult at first. It was a fighter base suddenly taken over by MATS and its seven transport squadrons (including 426 Sqn) And consequently there was a lack of servicing facilities, accommodations, messing and other amenities for such a large number of personnel and aircraft. These shortcomings were rapidly corrected as the US military machine swung into high gear and construction was begun at breakneck speed. Highly original nose hangars were just one of the buildings erected to address the lack of maintenance space and shelter.\u00a0\n\nRelations with their USAF counterparts were very good. 426 Squadron navigators helped develop a standard navigation briefing for all flights to Japan, while the maintainers quickly borrowed newer LORAN sets (radio navigation aids) from their USAF counterparts, to replace the wartime sets in service in the North Stars. This provided more accurate and reliable navigation assistance on the long distances flown between refueling stops. A gentleman\u2019s agreement was also arranged to provide flying hours for USAF navigators (of which there was a surplus) so that they could maintain their proficiency \u2013 essentially by having a USAF navigator fly with the squadron when the North Star carried only one RCAF navigator.\u00a0\n\nThe chosen route was via Elmendorf Air Force Base, near Anchorage, Alaska; Shemya Island, in the Aleutian chain; and Misawa, Japan, before offloading at Haneda, near Tokyo. The aircraft then returned via the same route. From the end of November 1950 to mid-June 1951, North Stars returning to McChord took a southern route back from Japan. This involved flying to Wake Island and Honolulu for refueling, before making landfall and refueling near San Francisco and then on to McChord. A total of 125 flights returned via this route, with injured American and Canadian servicemen being the main passengers.\n\nTo support these operations, a detachment of maintenance personnel was stationed in Alaska, initially at Elmendorf, before being moved to Adak and later Shemya, where they stayed until the end of the operation, and also at Haneda to prepare the North Stars for the long flight back to McChord. While the southern return route was in operation, a detachment was also maintained at Honolulu. That few flights suffered mechanical difficulties of any kind is testament to the skills of the ground crews.\n\nThe flights in 1950 carried mainly personnel and special freight, with mail for the Royal Canadian Navy destroyers when mail bags were ready. A MATS C-54 could only carry 7500-8500 lbs, while a North Star could carry 10,000. MATS put this capability to good use. Initially, flights were scheduled at the rate of one per day, but only 426 Squadron was able to meet that standard helped by the fact that 12 North Stars were on strength by October 1950. As MATS started returning its Berlin Airlift aircraft to service and as new aircraft were coming on line, the requirement to maintain one flight a day was reduced to 17 a month in February 1951, and then to 10 a month in June 1952.\u00a0\n\nThe flights to Japan were not easy. Icing was a problem for most of the year, while the Aleutians chain is also subject to dense fog on a more frequent basis than almost any other place on earth. Landings at Shemya were almost always under Ground Controlled Approach, and in winter had the additional hazard of strong winds. The route also took 426 Squadron close to the Soviet Union. Soviet bases often spoofed or mimicked western air traffic controllers in an effort to divert flights, while the slightest error in navigation could put an aircraft over Soviet territorial waters, where an interception could legally have taken place and the aircraft forced to land in the Soviet Union. Another problem was faulty charts. On one occasion, for example a North Star landing at a Japanese airfield to which the squadron had not flown before clipped the top of a mountain, while descending through clouds because the information provided by the navigator was erroneous. Despite all the risks, only one North Star crashed throughout the entire operation. On 27 December 1953, while returning from Japan, the nose strut of a North Star fractured on landing in Shemya during a heavy snow storm with strong cross-winds and a snow-covered runway. Although the aircraft slid into a gully and was a write-off, nobody was seriously injured.\u00a0\n\nRCAF North Stars flew to South Korea six times, five in 1951 and once in 1952. All trips departed from Japan, landed in South Korea, and departed within a few hours. On three occasions, this involved taking senior military personnel to meetings and twice bringing Christmas mail and goods to Canadian troops serving in Korea (1951 and 1952).\u00a0\n\nThe long distance training and the self-reliance of the maintenance detachments that these Trans-Pacific flights provided were a valuable opportunity for the RCAF to train personnel. In March 1951, the RCAF began rotating personnel through the air and ground crew positions, thereby providing as many airmen with experience in this manner of operation as possible.\n\nAlthough the Korean War ended with an armistice on July 1953, Operation Hawk continued, in part because no Western government was sure that the armistice would hold. The operation was finally concluded on 25 May 1954 after more than 34,000 flying hours. 426 Squadron airlifted more than 13,300 personnel across the Pacific and carried more than 7,000,000 lbs of freight. At least 764 personnel rotated through 426 Squadron."}}, {"opName": "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitarion of Korea", "countryRegion": "Korea", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1950-10-07", "endDate": "1973-11-28", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/united-nations-commission-unification-rehabilitarion-korea.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitarion of Korea (UNCURK)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "Korea", "Mission Date": "7 October 1950 - 28 November 1973", "Mission Mandate": " General Assembly Resolution 376 (V) - to unify and take measures to economically rehabilitate Korea", "Name": "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea", "Date": "7 October 1950 - 3 March 1951", "Canadian Task Force Name Abbreviation": "UNCURK", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " To unify and take measures to economically rehabilitate Korea General Assembly Resolution 293 (IV) - expanded to include observing and reporting on any developments that might lead to military conflict.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " On 12 December 1948, the United Nations General passed Resolution 195 (III) which created the United Nations Commission on Korea (UNCOK).

In fact, this became UNCOK\u2019s primary role. Australia provided the first UNCOK military observers, followed by Canada. On 28 June, the Canadian Cabinet approved the request from the Secretary-General to provide two military officers. On 6 July, Wing Commander Harry Malkin and Lieutenant Colonel Frank White were on their way, arriving in Pusan on 25 July. Once Seoul was re-occupied by the UN forces, they moved there. However, they retreated back to Pusan in early January when the communist forces led by the Chinese retook Seoul. W/C Malkin and Lt-Col White were part of an eight-person observer group. The observers were divided into two -person teams assisted by a Korean liaison representative. It was becoming obvious at the united Nations that UNCOK was not able to perform its mandate and that Korea would require massive assistance after the war ended. As a result UNCOK was terminated on 7 October 1950 when the General Assembly created the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea (UNCURK). Lt-Col White and W/C Malkin were transferred to the new organization, continuing to report on the situation on the ground. UNCURK\u2019s military observers were duplicating the observations of the UN Command in Korea, and were actually contributing very little. On 10 January 1950, UNCURK decided that only one military observer would be required to assist the mission. W/C Malkin volunteered to stay behind. UNCURK also decided not to request replacements for the observers. LCol White departed Korea in January 1951, as did the other UNCOK military observers. W/C Malkin departed Korea in late February, arriving in Canada on 2 March 1951.

While the battle lines moved north and south several times in the first year, by mid-1951, they had stabilized along what would be the eventual armistice line. With peace negotiations underway, it appeared that the Korean War would be over near the end of 1951. In response to the apparent looming end of the war, the United Nations Command (UNC), the organization charged with coordinating the UN effort in the war, suggested the creation of a UNC Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC). Unfortunately, hopes for an armistice were premature and the UMCMAC was not formed. In April 1953, hopes for an armistice again emerged. UNCMAC was established in July 1953 to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement, and to provide a mechanism to negotiate alleged violation of the truce. Each military representative was to assist UNCMAC on matters pertaining to their own forces, especially when violations were alleged by forces of their nation. The Korean Armistice Agreement is unique in that it is purely a military document. A key feature of the armistice is that no nation is a signatory to the agreement. The commander of the United Nations forces signed the Agreement on behalf of the unified command, consisting of the military forces from 16 UN nations and the Republic of Korea. UNCMAC, which is headquartered in Seoul and Panmunjom, is responsible for supervising the Military Armistice Agreement between North and South Korea along the 151 mile long Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). When initial plans were made to form UNCMAC, Canada, as one of the 16 nations contributing personnel to the war effort, was asked to contribute an officer at the Colonel or Lieutenant-Colonel rank. In December 1951, this request was approved, and an officer was selected and sent. As this effort to implement UNCMAC was fruitless, UNCMAC was held in abeyance; however, the Canadian officer remained in theatre as a liaison. With the armistice becoming a greater possibility in early 1953, Canada\u2019s UNCMAC participation was again requested and approved on 27 April 1953. A second Lieutenant-Colonel had been selected and sent to Korea and was in theatre when UNCMAC was stood up in July 1953. He recommended that Canada\u2019s interests could be best served with a Major. Within six months, it became obvious to him that the work of UNCMAC was at a standstill, and recommended that Canada withdraw. The Department of External Affairs, however, saw value in the reports that were being provided by the Canadian military representative. Canada had no diplomatic representation in South Korea at the time, thus the military officer provided valuable insight that External Affairs could not otherwise gain. The Canadian representation therefore continued. Canada maintained one Major and one Sergeant with UNCMAC into the 1970s. They participated in guard post inspections, investigations of cease-fire violations and other events and ceremonies including repatriations of war remains from North Korea. In 1978 this responsibility was handed over to the Canadian Forces Attach\u00e9 in the Canadian Embassy in Seoul, South Korea. With the transfer of responsibility, UNCMAC ceased to be a Canadian Forces operation. As it now exists, UNCMAC consists of five members: a senior member (Korean Major-General), a United States member (US Major-General), a Korean member (Korean Brigadier-General), a Commonwealth member (British Brigadier) and a rotating member from the UNCMAC Advisory Group. As a member of UNCMAC Advisory Group, Canada participates on a rotational basis, once every two years for a six-month period. The Canadian Forces Attach\u00e9 represents Canada on UNCMAC, as part of the Attach\u00e9\u2019s normal duties and not a special CF operation."}}, {"opName": "International Commission for Supervision and Control - Laos (I)", "countryRegion": "Laos", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1954-08-11", "endDate": "1958-05-31", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/international-commission-supervision-control-laos.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "International Commission for Supervision and Control - Laos (I)", "International Mission Name": "International Commission for Supervision and Control - Laos (I) (ICSC - Laos)", "Mandating Organization": "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos, 21 July 1954", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "Laos", "Mission Date": "11 August 1954 - 31 May 1958", "Mission Mandate": " To implement the terms of the Geneva Agreement", "Mission/Operation Notes": " Laos was a political hotbed of intrigue after the Second World War. At the end of the war, the Lao Issara (Free Lao) movement established itself as the rulers of Laos. In October 1945, they drew up a new constitution proclaiming their independence from France. In April 1946, Sisavang Vong joined the Lao Issara and was installed as King of Laos. Two days later, French forces and Laotian guerrillas, calling themselves the \u201cFree French\u201d, captured the capital Vientiane and defeated the Lao Issara forces as well as some North Vietnamese forces in Laos. The French now found themselves ruling a Laos that was in dire economic and financial straits, and for which the government in France could provide no aid. By late 1946, the French asked the Lao Issara to enter into formal talks for a transition of power. Unfortunately, by this time the Lao Issara had split into three factions. Prince Souphanouvong, one of the leaders of a faction, wanted the assistance of the Viet Minh to create an independent Laotian state. In 1948 he turned to Ho Chi Minh, who not only supported him but also Kaysone Phomvihane, who was busy recruiting tribes for the communist cause along the Laos-Vietnam border. They formed the Free Lao Front, better known as the Pathet Lao, with Viet Minh support in 1950, but were completely dominated by the North Vietnamese. Twice between 1951 and 1954, the Viet Minh invaded the country to put pressure on the French forces, and thereby assist in the defeat of the French in Vietnam. The French granted Laos independence in October 1953; however, they did maintain forces in the country. Following the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam in 1954, Lao resistance increased in the countryside. The United States rushed increasing amounts of aid to support the government. By the Geneva Agreement, the Pathet Lao were to be integrated into the Laotian military and society. Laos could import arms for its own defence, but could not join any military alliances. France could retain two bases and train the Laotian military, with French personnel being integrated into the latter organization. Elections were also slated for 1955. Pathet Lao forces were also required to congregate in the two northern provinces, which would be a source of problems later. The ICSC was composed of a headquarters in Vientiane and five fixed teams. The headquarters and teams operated under rules similar to those of the ICSC-Vietnam. As with the other ICSCs, the ICSC-Laos was hindered in its operations by its own internal problems and by the signatories to the agreement. The Pathet Lao imposed restrictions on the travel of the ICSC teams \u201cto ensure their safety\u201d, thus effectively keeping their own illegal activities hidden. They also used a systematic campaign of harassment, obstruction and violence against the ICSC teams. At one point they even completely surrounded an ICSC team and prevented it from moving. The Polish members attempted to limit the import of arms by the Royal Laotian Government (RLG) and the French, although arms importation was allowed by the Agreement. The Indians\u2019 indecisiveness aided the Polish attempts at aiding the Pathet Lao and Viet Minh by not condemning obvious cease-fire violations. A further problem was the fact that the ICSC simply did not have enough personnel to complete their mission. To ensure that there was no infiltration of foreign troops into Laos would have required several thousand observers, not the less than 100 who were there. On 18 November 1957, all parties in Laos signed the Vientiane Agreement, which formed the basis for elections and integration of the Pathet Lao into the political mainstream. The ICSC had played a major part in keeping the negotiations going between the two sides. The elections of 4 May 1958 ended the requirement for the ICSC in Laos. The Royal Laotian Government therefore asked the ICSC to depart, which it did by late May 1958. ICSC Laos was only adjourned, however, as a compromise between the Canadian, Indian and Polish head of delegations. The election of May 1958 and the rapprochement of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Laotian Government were to be only temporary. The elections demonstrated that the Pathet Lao had widespread popular support in the two northeast provinces, winning 13 of 21 seats. As a result the United States cut off all aid to Laos, aid that had been a major part of Laos\u2019 economy. At the same time there were problems integrating Pathet Lao fighters into the Royal Lao Army, mainly over the question of rank. A right-wing reaction led to the arrest of Pathet Lao ministers and deputies in the government, with the result that the Pathet Lao began establishing themselves in the countryside again. With North Vietnamese assistance they began gaining control over tribes in the north and northeast. Fighting broke out on the Plain of Jars during the summer of 1959, continuing into 1961. A coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in August 1960 brought a neutralist faction, led by Kong Le into power. Laos degenerated into chaos as the left wing Pathet Lao, a neutralist faction and the right wing all jockeyed for control. The Pathet Lao and the right wing were supported by the USSR and the US respectively. In May 1961, a 14-nation conference began in Geneva. In July 1962 a new set of agreements was signed, creating an independent, neutral Laos. The ICSC was recalled to observe the agreement. Under this new agreement, the ICSC fared little better than the first time. Efforts to make the ICSC more effective, such as the Canadian suggestion to allow mobile inspection teams to conduct surprise visits, were impeded by the Indian and Polish representatives. All three factions in Laos also did their best to hinder the operations of the ICSC. When the ICSC did note North Vietnamese violations, the Pathet Lao further tightened their travel and inspection restrictions. The second Geneva Agreement was doomed to failure. North Vietnam apparently had no intention to live up to the agreement. In violation of the accord, it maintained over 7,000 troops in Laos after the agreement was signed. The three factions also sealed the fate of the agreement by posturing for power. In the northeast, the neutralists and Pathet Lao fought skirmishes over control, before the political alignment became one of neutralist and right wing versus Pathet Lao. The Pathet Lao thereupon made no further effort to reconcile, and further called upon North Vietnamese assistance. In Laos, the CIA trained Hmong tribesmen in mountain warfare, under the command of the Royal Lao Army and with Thai assistance. The Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Army built up their forces and by 1971 even had Chinese air defence forces and civilians building roads in support of their efforts. A cease-fire agreement was reached in 1973, which the ICSC was once again called upon to supervise. Canada decided that this agreement was not part of the original ICSC framework and declined to participate.

At the request of the United Nations, a CC-130 Hercules from 436 Squadron already in Bangkok on an around-the-world training flight was also diverted to evacuate UN personnel and foreign nationals from East Pakistan. Although assured of safe passage, on 6 December it had to turn back when only ten minutes from Dacca because the airport there had been attacked less than an hour before and could not receive any aircraft. Another attempt on 7 December was aborted because of anti-aircraft fire in the area.\n\nOn 11 December, the Hercules flew to Calcutta, India. There it remained until the crew had been given apparent permission to fly to Dacca by both Indian and Pakistani authorities. However, when the pilot contacted Dacca control, he was advised that he would be shot down if he proceeded to land there. The flight returned to Calcutta and then to Bangkok later in the day, and continued on with its original mission two days later."}}, {"opName": "DECIMAL", "countryRegion": "Pakistan", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1989-02-01", "endDate": "2019-02-23", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/decimal.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian / Mine Awareness and Clearance Training", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian / Mine Awareness and Clearance Training (UNOCA / MACTP)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "Pakistan", "Mission Date": "1 February 1989 - Present", "Mission Mandate": " The United Nations launched Operation SALAM to assist in the return of refugees to, and the rehabilitation of, Afghanistan. Operation SALAM included a mine awareness training program designed for Afghan de-miners and to provide mine awareness training to returning Afghan refugees", "Mission/Operation Notes": " With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, that country soon became home to one of the largest landmine problems in the world: an estimated 10 million mines had been scattered through the country and, more particularly, on the Pakistan-Afghan frontier, the route home for the estimated 6-8 million refugees who had sought safe haven in Pakistan. Dropped or laid mainly by the Soviet Union, these primarily anti-personnel mines had effectively reduced the amount of land under cultivation in Afghanistan by 40 per cent: the farmland was simply too dangerous to work. But Soviet mines were not the only danger: the Mujahideen had scattered anti-tank and anti-vehicle mines in large numbers as well, and neither side had maintained accurate records as to where the mines were located. In February 1989 the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan. The United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) attempted to return refugees to their home. In this effort, they cooperated with other United Nations agencies and certain non-governmental organisations. As part of this effort, the World Food Program provided 60,000 tons of food to needy Afghans in 1991 alone, while the Food and Agriculture Organization provided 6,800 tons of seeds and more than 500,000 fruit and poplar saplings. UNOCA also assumed responsibility for the Mine Awareness and Clearance Training Program, which would subsequently become an integral part of Op SALAM. The key objectives of MACTP were to increase awareness among refugees of the dangers they would face from mines as they returned to Afghanistan and to train 15,000 Afghan deminers.", "Name": "DECIMAL", "Date": "17 February 1989 - 31 August 1990", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canadian participation in MACTP began on 10 June 1988 with a request from the UN Secretary General. A two-man reconnaissance team went to Pakistan in December and, following consultations there, recommended that the commitment should be set at twelve, including three female officers to work with local women. They also recommended that the deployment be for four months. These recommendations were accepted, and NDHQ issued its tasking order (under the designation Operation DECIMAL) on 17 February 1989. Given the unit name of Canadian Contingent MACTP (CC MACTP), the Canadians arrived in Pakistan on 23 March 1989. Operating in Peshawar, the CC MACTP was soon busy in training Afghan Mine Clearance Training Instructors and in mine awareness training. Two all-male teams provided instruction on a Mine Clearance Training Course, while the female members provided technical advice to, and instructed on the Mine Awareness Programme (MAP), mainly to non-governmental organizations. The senior Canadian female officer filled the position of Mine Awareness Program Coordinator. The term for the first contingent expired on 25 July. The second contingent arrived in Pakistan on 17 July. Progress made during the initial rotation as well as internal MACTP reorganization meant that the mine clearance training and awareness programmes were able to run smoothly, and that persuaded Canada that it would be worthwhile to continue its contribution at least until August 1990. The third contingent arrived in Islamabad on 20 November 1989, with the outgoing rotation departing on 24 November. The new rotation continued the work of the previous two contingents. They, too, continued to improve the program of instruction and develop new training aids, including a handbook for illiterate people. Taking local cultural imperatives into consideration, two different curricula were also developed, one for men and another for women. The fourth contingent arrived on 23 March 1990. They continued the work of the previous rotation, but also advanced several other programs, including a \u201cbooby-trapped\u201d house for training purposes. They returned to Canada at the end of August 1990, which terminated Op DECIMAL.

They were also to ensure that no new military equipment entered Vietnam, except to replace equipment that was destroyed or otherwise eliminated. This was supposed to maintain military forces at the 1954 level. New military facilities could also not be built. Violations were to be reported to the ICSC who would send teams to investigate. To enforce these regulations, the ICSC had representatives in Hanoi and Saigon. The ICSC-Vietnam headquarters were initially in Hanoi, moving to Saigon in April 1958. Until that time, the headquarters would visit with the South Vietnamese authorities several times a year, each visit being of six-week duration. Seven teams were in the north and seven in the south, each team having two members from each of the three ICSC supporting nations. The teams were situated at points of entry for air, rail and sea and had prescribed areas of supervision outside of which they could not venture. \u201cMobile teams\u201d were also allowed, composed of three persons, who were to have freedom of movement across border zones and the demilitarized zone. Their role was to patrol gaps between the fixed team areas and to control points of entry that became active after the Geneva Agreement. The number of mobile teams was never set by the Agreement and the mobile teams were never allowed to function as intended. Within the first year, the ICSC had successfully overseen the transfer of power to the North and South regimes, and the withdrawal of French forces from Vietnam. The task of overseeing the return of displaced persons and refugees was to remain a problem through the ICSC\u2019s service, while the issue of keeping out military equipment and personnel was a complete failure. More problematic still was the question of holding free and fair elections for all of Vietnam by 1956. Western nations, including Canada, recognized that the Communists would most likely win the election and thereby unite Vietnam under a leftist regime in Hanoi. Given the anti-communist rhetoric of the era, the West could not be seen to allow the imposition of such a regime on the South. The elections were therefore postponed by the Government of South Vietnam, with the tacit approval of the West. With no election looming, the North set about infiltrating communist agents to generate support for the North and to foment revolution from within South Vietnam. Recourse to violence was therefore only a matter of time. With the onset of open warfare in Vietnam in 1965, the ICSC lost all effectiveness. The North Vietnamese indicated in March 1965 that the ICSC was no longer welcome in Hanoi, forcing it to move and also resulting in the departure of the seven fixed teams in that country. The rationale was that the North Vietnamese could not protect the ICSC from American attacks. Further exacerbating the ineffectiveness of the ICSC was the fact that ICSC teams never found anything in their inspections. This was carefully orchestrated by both North and South Vietnam. The fixed teams also made a mockery of impartiality. They required unanimity before carrying out any activity, a unanimity that was rarely available immediately. Only after a potentially embarrassing incident was over would a team be allowed to inspect a ship or a site. The failure of the ICSC stemmed largely from the terms of the Geneva Accords. While all parties agreed to an early French departure and the creation of separate regimes in the North and South - aspects that were swiftly and successfully implemented - the ICSC had no real power to supervise or control situations where there was no agreement. Accordingly, both the North and the South Vietnamese governments conspired to import weapons through the simple expedient of denying the ICSC access to ports and airfields when illicit cargo arrived. Furthermore, none of the ICSC member-states approached their tasks in an absolutely neutral and objective manner.", "Date": "10 August 1954 - 31 July 1973", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canadian participation in ICSC-Vietnam was mostly from the army, providing inspectors, clerks, communications, medical and security personnel. They manned the fixed and mobile teams throughout the two countries. The RCAF also had three officers and the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) three officers present in Vietnam throughout the service of the ICSC, to provide technical advice and to carry out inspections of facilities and patrols. The RCAF officers were mainly involved in inspecting airfields to ensure that they had no military usage or capability. They could also be called upon to inspect aircraft that were unloading cargo, although normally the efforts of North and South Vietnam hindered this activity. Both parties also provided boats to the RCN officers in order to patrol the coastline. They rarely saw anything that resembled arms smuggling or shipments, as these activities were conducted away from the inspection teams\u2019 presence. The RCN officers were also supposed to be able to inspect merchant vessels; however, this activity was again hindered by both sides. At its peak in July 1955, the Canadian Forces had 53 officers and 29 non-commissioned members in Vietnam. This decreased slightly to 41 and 27 by the end of 1959. In addition, the Department of External Affairs had about 16 personnel in Vietnam at this time. The military numbers slowly reduced during the 1960s so that by the start of 1970 there were around 20 personnel. Two military members and one member from External Affairs were killed while serving with the ICSC. Sgt J.S. Byrne and Cpl V.J. Perkin were killed in an aircraft accident over North Vietnam on 18 October 1965, while enroute to Hanoi from Vientiane. Their bodies were never recovered. With the withdrawal of the United States from Vietnam, the United States asked Canada in January 1973 to participate in the International Commission for Control and Supervision (ICCS). Canada agreed, on the condition that Canada could withdraw if the ICCS proved to be non-effective. The creation of the ICCS on 29 January 1973 effectively ended the ICSC. The last Canadian members of the ICSC withdrew in July 1973."}}, {"opName": "GALLANT", "countryRegion": "Vietnam", "continent": "Asia", "startDate": "1973-01-29", "endDate": "1975-04-30", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/asia-pacific/gallant.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "International Commission for Control and Supervision", "International Mission Name": "International Commission for Control and Supervision (ICCS)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Asia", "Location": "Vietnam", "Mission Date": "29 January 1973 - 30 April 1975", "Mission Mandate": " To provide a neutral party to investigate compliance and to conduct monitor the enforcement of the terms of the Paris Peace Agreement", "Mission/Operation Notes": " The Geneva Accords of July 1954 had foreseen the creation of a single, united Vietnamese state, but disagreements over the election process that year resulted in the de facto creation of two separate Vietnams: The Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) backed by the united States, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) backed by the Soviet Union. Almost immediately, communist and populist groups in the south supported by the northern regime, began a guerrilla campaign aimed at the forcible reunification of the country under Hanoi\u2019s authority. That insurgency grew in scope until open war broke out in 1965, when both the United States (along with other allies) and North Vietnam entered the conflict in a major (and public) way. By 1972, large tracts of South Vietnam were controlled by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam (Viet Cong) or the North Vietnamese army, the South\u2019s ability to retain control of the rest was clearly diminishing, and the United States was anxious to negotiate a peace agreement that would allow it to withdraw its forces from Southeast Asia \u201cwith honor.\u201d As a result, on 27 January 1973, after years of on and-off discussions, the \u201cAgreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam\u201d was signed in Paris by the United States, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam (Viet Cong). This agreement created a Joint Military Commission, composed of the four signatories to the peace agreement, to oversee the implementation of the agreement and to settle disputes arising from it. The agreement also created the International Commission of Control and Supervision (ICCS) to act as a neutral party in investigating disputes and in supervising some aspects of the agreement. A second international conference held in Paris from 26 February to 2 March 1973 created the reporting mechanisms for the ICCS and established its rules of conduct. Canada, Hungary, Indonesia, and Poland, the four nations that would form the ICCS, were party to the negotiations and signed the agreement on 2 March. The ICCS, with its 1160 personnel, had its headquarters in Saigon, in fact taking over the headquarters of the former International Commission for Supervision and Control (ICSC). Seven teams were set up to supervise prisoner of war and civilian detainee exchanges, three teams for regional operations, and five teams to carry out such other duties as were required. In addition, seven regional headquarters across South Vietnam would supervise the operations of forty field teams, each of which comprised representatives of all four ICCS nations. These teams were to have freedom of movement in order to carry out their tasks and would have diplomatic status. Twelve of these teams were to inspect designated points of entry in South Vietnam for restricted war materiel, while two more were available for inspections at a point of entry to be designated by South Vietnam. Each ICCS team worked with a local Joint Military Team (JMT), part of the JMC. The ICCS teams were expected to provide impartial reports on incidents to these JMT. The active roles of the ICCS were to assist in the exchange of captured and detained personnel and to monitor the flow of restricted war materiel into South Vietnam. The ICCS would also monitor and investigate all breaches of the cease-fire brought to their attention by any parties to the agreement, by the JMT, or through its own efforts. An additional role, but one in which Canada had no opportunity to take part, was to monitor the scheduled all-party elections in South Vietnam. In the first 60 days, the seven prisoner of war teams visited locations across North and South Vietnam, supervising the release of over 32,000 POWs. The release of civilian detainees was more problematic as both North and South Vietnam were determined to gain the maximum political and propaganda advantage from these releases. As a result, only a small percentage of the detainees were actually released. When it came to monitoring the influx of restricted materiel, while South Vietnamese authorities were cooperative the Viet Cong were not, and that prevented the ICCS from carrying out its assigned duties fairly and equitably. The same was true of its cease-fire monitoring role: in the first six months there were at least 18,000 reported violations, causing 76,000 casualties, just four thousand casualties short of the total recorded in the last six months of actual fighting. The ICCS investigated 1,081 complaints during the period that Canada was a member. South Vietnam laid ninety-five percent of these complaints, but few were investigated because of the same requirement for unanimity that had hamstrung the ICSC: all too often, the Polish or Hungarian representatives concluded that the South Vietnamese had actually been responsible for the violation and that further investigation and rapportage was therefore unwarranted. In short, few reports were written. The JMC were equally ineffective as political machinations prevented their reaching any decisions regarding interpretations of the Paris Agreement when questions arose.", "Date": "29 January 1973 - 31 July 1973", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Having participated in the ICSC-Vietnam from 1954 to its dissolution in 1973 and thoroughly disillusioned with both its structure and working mechanisms, Canada doubted whether the ICCS had any better chance of achieving lasting peace and stability. Accordingly, while Ottawa agreed to participate in the ICCS for an initial period of sixty days, Canada insisted upon having the right to withdraw if it found that the ICCS was ineffective. The Canadian contribution to ICCS was to be 240 military personnel and fifty from the Department of External Affairs. As Canada had been kept abreast of the negotiations in Paris, Ottawa was ready when the agreement was signed on 27 January. Firm planning for Operation GALLANT had begun in December 1972, and a two-man advance party arrived in Saigon only days before the formal Canadian contingent itself on 29 January. (It would be led by Michel Gauvin, head of the Canadian delegation and ambassador to Vietnam, and Major-General Duncan McAlpine, the Canadian Forces commander.) All were airlifted from Trenton by 436 Squadron Hercules. So quick was the Canadian response, in fact, that the ICCS operational plan was not ready when they arrived, but the contingent was nevertheless soon transported to its assigned sites. As some were accessible only by air, on 27 February a contract was let to Air America Inc, a commercial enterprise generally accepted as having close links to the American Central Intelligence Agency-backed operation and operating now under the name \u201cICCS Air Services.\u201d However, the Viet Cong\u2019s refusal to clarify air regulations over territory it controlled resulted in some sites not being resupplied for several weeks or more: ICCS team members at An Loc, for example, had to fend for themselves for seventy-five days. There were casualties. An ICCS helicopter was shot down on 7 April over Viet Cong territory, killing all 9 onboard, including one Canadian, Captain C.E. Laviolette, two Hungarians, one Indonesian, two Viet Cong liaison officers and a three-man crew. All ICCS flights were temporarily grounded. Then, on 28 June, two Canadian officers, Captains Ian Patten and Fletcher Thomson, were kidnapped by the Viet Cong just east of Saigon, but careful negotiations finally resulted in their release after seventeen days. Operationally, conditions were harsh, and unexploded ordnance was an ever-present danger. So were booby-traps left over from the actual fighting. For their part, although guilty of obstructing much of the ICCS\u2019s work, the Viet Cong generally tried to make living conditions in sites as comfortable as possible and some, particularly those near former American bases, were very well-equipped. As a result, a rotation policy was devised to move ICCS teams between them and more difficult locations. Although convinced within the first month that the ICCS was as ineffective as its ICSC predecessor, Canada chose to remain a participant for two months beyond its initial, limited commitment; but when there was no noticeable improvement in the prospects for success during this period, Canada finally indicated it would withdraw effective 31 July 1973. On 31 July, two 437 Squadron Boeing 707s evacuated the entire Canadian ICCS contingent from Saigon, while a 436 Squadron Hercules carried the luggage and other equipment. Iranian forces replaced the Canadians until the work of the ICCS came to an end with the fall of the South Vietnamese government on 30 April 1975. Canada maintained one ship near Vietnam from May to July 1973, under the deployment name WESTPLOY.

Canada, Hungary, Indonesia, and Poland were invited to participate as neutral monitors to the process under the name International Commission on Control and Supervision (ICCS). In late January Canada began to send the first of 290 military and civilian personnel to Vietnam under the name Operation GALLANT, but having participated in the ICCS predecessor -- the International Commission for Supervision and Control Vietnam -- Canada suspected that the ICCS would probably not be an effective operation, and reserved the right to withdraw. Once the Canadian contingent began active preparations to deploy to Vietnam it was realised that conditions there might produce a requirement for their emergency evacuation from the country. The Military Component, Canadian Delegation (MCCD), as the CF contingent to ICCS was named, suggested on 12 February that evacuation by air was the favoured choice, but because there was no guarantee that Vietnamese airspace would be safe, sea evacuation was the obvious alternative. Accordingly, one Canadian ship was to be deployed to the region on a stand-by basis. HMCS Terra Nova was the first ship selected: ordered to return to Esquimalt \u201cwith dispatch\u201d on 26 January, she prepared for the deployment over the course of the weekend and sailed on 29 January under the name WESTPLOY 1/73. HMCS Terra Nova was ordered to remain within 36 hours sailing of any of the designated Vietnamese evacuation ports, but rather than simply maintain station, she was also ordered to exercise with whatever American, Australian, British, or New Zealand warships she might encounter. Provisioning would be carried out at Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Subic Bay in the Philippines as required, supplemented by 437 Squadron Boeings transporting spare parts, mail, and miscellaneous other supplies. Although the initial evacuation plan had been prepared by the MCCD in consultation with US naval authorities on 12 February, it was updated by the MCCD working with Terra Nova and, later, Kootenay. HMCS Terra Nova was in her operational area by 3 March and, as instructed, conducted various exercises with Australian, British and New Zealand ships during her three month tour. When not in company with these vessels, she conducted readiness training. As originally ordered, she rendezvoused with her replacement, HMCS Kootenay, on 6 June in the Straits of San Bernardino between the islands of Luzon and Samar in the Philippines. In a four-hour turnover conducted at sea, Terra Nova briefed Kootenay before heading back to Esquimalt. HMCS Kootenay had left Esquimalt on 14 May, on Westploy 2/73. Kootenay\u2019s routine was similar to that of Terra Nova, exercising with American and Australian naval vessels, and assisting broken-down fishermen.

The result was a refugee crisis, which garnered world attention. Of particular international interest was the case of the freighter Hai Hong, a dilapidated cargo ship that arrived off the coast of Malaysia in 1978 carrying some 2500 Indochinese refugees. The Malaysian government, already beleaguered by waves of refugees since 1975, refused requests by the Hai Hong to dock and disembark, though it was allowed to remain in Kuala Lumpur harbour.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " The Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, having re-written the Canadian Immigration Act in 1977 to include special 'humanitarian' categories for refugees in emergency situations, reacted quickly to this international crisis, agreeing to welcome 600 persons from the Hai Hong into Canada as refugees. The government called upon the Canadian Forces to assist in the transport and processing of Hai Hong refugees, and dubbed the tasking Operation MAGNET, officially starting on 24 November 1978. Op MAGNET would be placed under the command of the Longue Pointe Garrison at CFB Montreal, augmented by personnel from 3rd Battalion, Royal 22e Regiment, 5 Field Ambulance and CFB Valcartier. Their task was to turn Longue Pointe into an accommodations and processing centre for incoming refugees, who would then be dispersed to 13 major centres across Canada to complete the refugee application process. A CF Medical Evacuation Team would also be sent to the Canadian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to record and perform medical checks on all refugees before transport.

The territory of West Irian/West New Guinea on the western half of the island of New Guinea had been a possession of the Netherlands since 1828. In the treaty creating Indonesia from former Dutch possessions, a decision on the status of West New Guinea was postponed; however, Indonesia coveted this territory and claimed it as its own. Between 1954 and 1961, Indonesia brought the issue of West New Guinea to the United Nations General Assembly on several occasions, all without success. While the Netherlands did not necessarily disagree with transferring the territory to Indonesia, the means of doing so was problematic. With increasing tensions between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the Secretary-General, U Thant, offered his good offices as a means to resolve the dispute. Informal talks, with retired United States diplomat Ellsworth Bunker acting as the Secretary-General\u2019s representative, started in early 1962, but a stumbling block was Indonesia\u2019s insistence that the territory be transferred without consulting the inhabitants. For its part, the Netherlands believed the inhabitants should have the right to self-determination. To support its claims, Indonesia landed paratroops in West New Guinea, while its navy lost a small naval engagement to the Dutch navy. Despite the increased tensions, a preliminary agreement was reached on 31 July, with a final agreement being arrived at on 15 August. The agreement called for the Netherlands to transfer the administration of West New Guinea to the United Nations as of 1 October. The United Nations Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) would then provide governmental and security services until 1 May 1963 at which time the territory would be transferred to Indonesia. Assisting UNTEA would be the United Nations Security Force (UNSF), responsible for augmenting the existing police forces in maintaining law and order in West New Guinea. Pakistan would provide the bulk of the personnel for UNSF (1500 soldiers), including the force commander, while the United States provided a USAF detachment flying C-47 Dakotas and H-19 helicopters. The Royal Canadian Air Force was requested to provide amphibious Otters.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canadian planning for a role in West New Guinea began on 16 August 1963 when Canada was requested to send an air advisor to the UNSF Commander and a float-equipped Otter with flying and ground crew. RCAF headquarters suggested that two Otters and an air advisor would be necessary. The request went before Cabinet on 29 August and the request was approved. On 30 August, two CC-130 Hercules aircraft left RCAF Station Trenton, westward bound for West New Guinea. Inside were two disassembled Otters, spare parts and 11 members of what was to become No. 116 Air Transport Unit (ATU). The Hercules were so crowded that some members of No. 116 ATU rode inside the Otters. They, and the air advisor, arrived in West New Guinea on 3 September. W/C Herbert remained stationed at UNSF headquarters in Hollandia, 275 miles to the east of the remaining Canadians, arranging and coordinating the daily airlift requirements. Once UNTEA assumed responsibility for West New Guinea, No. 116 ATU began operations on 12 September, under Command of the local contingent. Most trips involved carrying passengers, mail and fresh food to the Pakistani garrisons throughout the territory. These were supplemented by flights carrying UN personnel on inspections. In the seven months that No. 116 ATU operated under UNSF and UNTEA, its 11 members supported and flew 675 hours under some of the most trying conditions in the world. This was accomplished without a single accident. W/C Herbert, as Air Advisor, coordinated all air movements and the re-supply of 1,500 Pakistani soldiers and various UN officials. The transfer of power from UNTEA to Indonesia did not resolve the West New Guinea problem, and the rights of its people to self- determination - this only occurred in 1969."}}, {"opName": "SCHOOL SUPPLIES", "countryRegion": "Antigua", "continent": "Caribbean", "startDate": "1966-07-04", "endDate": "1966-07-07", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/caribbean/school-supplies.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Antigua 1966", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Mission Mandate": "To transport school supplies to Antigua, West Indies.", "Region Name": "Central America", "Location": "Antigua", "Mission Date": "4 July 1966 - 7 July 1966", "Name": "Operation SCHOOL SUPPLIES", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " At the request of the Minister of Education for the Province of Ontario, the Minister of National Defence assigned two C130 Hercules to Operation SCHOOL SUPPLIES.

The latter promptly withdrew from the Embassy when the Dominican President, Juan Bosch, threatened to use force against Haiti. A standoff ensued - the Haitian authorities would not allow the anti-government forces in the Embassy to leave, while President Bosch wanted them off of Dominican territory. In support of his demand, Bosch built up his forces along the Haitian border, prompting an escalation in tensions. The Haitian troops surrounding the Embassy withdrew on 13 May; however it was the anti-government plotters who were not immediately allowed to leave.

In November 1991, the country was stable but it was anticipated that the dwindling fuel stocks caused by the embargo would eventually destabilize the situation. In early November, the Department of External Affairs (DEA) asked DND to contact the US Department of Defence and begin planning for the evacuation of an estimated 1600 Canadian citizens from the island. Working closely with the American JTF-120 command as well as French forces, the plan, now under the Canadian designation Operation ESCORT, called for the deployment of two CC-137 aircraft for the evacuation phase, a CC-130 aircraft as required for deployment/redeployment, a six-man Airlift Control Element evacuee processing unit, three 10-man Mobile Air Movements Sections and MCC support, and a two-man service and support unit.

Additionally there would be one infantry platoon for airfield security and an evacuation platoon to conduct medical and security screening and assist DEA to process evacuees.\u00a0\n\nThe plan called for the military teams to arrive (with permission from the Haitian military junta) and establish a security perimeter around the Port-au-Prince airport. American and French troops would provide security for the outer cordon with the Canadian security platoon providing security for the inner cordon and Canadian processing teams. Once an outer cordon had been established, evacuees would pass through an initial screening by American or French troops, and proceed to the inner cordon located just inside the main terminal building.\u00a0\n\nThere a team would then determine an evacuee\u2019s country of destination, that evacuees carried no restricted material and that the evacuee was bona fide based on a second document check. The inner cordon would then direct the evacuee to the proper national screening area where they would be medically screened (and given treatment if necessary), fed and provided with an area for personal hygiene and rest until baggage and personnel were placed on the aircraft. A Padre and a Judge Advocate General representative would be made available at this time.\u00a0\n\nOnce the evacuees were processed, command was to close down the operation, clear the area, mount the aircraft and redeploy via Charleston, USA, where all evacuees would be flown for further processing. From Charleston they would then travel to their final destination.\u00a0\n\nThough the operation was anticipated to take no more than seven days, the largest threat to the operation was expected to come from pro-Aristide factions, who upon realizing that an evacuation was taking place, would petition the evacuating forces for help in overthrowing the military government.

The Secretary-General agreed with Haitian authorities that the presence and assistance of the international community continued to be required to support the Haitian National Police (HNP), and to consolidate the progress achieved by the Haitian people after the restoration of democracy. According to the Secretary-General, it was clear that HNP was still not in a position to ensure, on its own, the stable and secure environment required for the consolidation of democratic rule. He further suggested that the complete withdrawal of the United Nations military and police presence could jeopardize the success achieved until then. He therefore recommended the establishment of a new mission with a limited mandate. Subsequently on the 28 June 1996, the Security Council passed Resolution UNSCR 1063 establishing the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH). The Council decided that UNSMIH would initially be composed of 300 civilian police personnel and 600 troops. In addition, 700 voluntarily funded military personnel were provided to serve with UNSMIH. UNSMIH's initial mandate period extended until 30 November 1996. On 13 November 1996, the President of Haiti, Mr. Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, requested the extension of the UNSMIH mandate. The Secretary-General had already reported to the Council that there had been some improvement in the security situation in Haiti and in the capacity of the HNP to confront challenges. However he felt the HNP had not yet reached the level of experience and confidence required to control and defeat threats posed by subversive groups. It was clear that the presence of the UNSMIH military element was still a key factor in the ability of the Haitian authorities to contain the danger of destabilization by forces threatening democracy. The Secretary-General agreed. The Security Council subsequently passed Resolution 1086 (1996) to extend UNSMIH's mandate until 31 May 1997 with a maximum strength of 300 civilian police personnel and 500 troops.

Early in UNSMIH\u2019s mandate President Rene Pr\u00e9val had requested that United Nations support for the training of the Haitian National Police (HNP) be extended to 12 months to ensure that the HNP could provide a secure and stable environment without international support.

Staging out of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic capital, between Saturday 28 February and Wednesday 3 March 2004 CF aircraft conducted 11 flights transporting about 340 people out of Haiti, of which approximately 200 were Canadian Citizens. The remainder were of different nationalities and included French, American and Dutch citizens. CF aircraft also delivered 50 liters of blood from the Dominican Republic to Haiti on behalf of the Red Cross, delivered five pallets of humanitarian aid supplies, and evacuated one woman who had suffered gunshot wounds. By Wednesday the 3rd of March, commercial flights had begun flying into Port-au-Prince again and the requirement to evacuate personnel no longer existed.

By March 2000, the United Nations had successfully made the transition from peacekeeping to a peace-support mission, when the last of the international troops handed responsibility over to the International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH) and departed the country. Yet before the end of the last UN peacekeeping missions\u2019 mandate, the Pr\u00e9val Government had fallen into disarray. The legislature was divided into political factions and was unable to approve government budgets or authorize the distribution of foreign aid. In March 1999 President Pr\u00e9val appointed a new government by decree, with former education minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis as prime minister. Under pressure from a new political opposition coalition called the Democratic Consultation Group (ESPACE), the government formed a nine member Provisional Electoral Council with the mandate to organize the overdue municipal and legislative elections before the end of 1999. Following a series of delays, first round elections took place on 21 May 2000, and in the face of opposition protests of election fraud, Haiti\u2019s new Parliament was convened on August 28. Despite international protest regarding the validity of the May elections, the newly formed parliament pressed forward with elections for President and nine Senators on 26 November. Concurrently, most opposition parties regrouped into an alliance that became known as The Democratic Convergence. The Convergence continued to assert that the May elections had been fraudulent and subsequently boycotted the November parliamentary elections. With all major opposition parties boycotting the November elections voter participation was estimated at only 5. With such low voter turnout Jean-Bertrand Aristide emerged as the easy victor, and on 7 February 2001 he was sworn in as President. The political opposition steadfastly opposed Aristide\u2019s presidency, refusing to recognize its legitimacy. It boycotted the legislative elections scheduled for late 2003 and as a consequence the elections failed. In January 2004, the previous legislature\u2019s term expired and the legislature was dissolved, leaving President Aristide to rule a severely divided nation by executive decree. In early February 2004 heavily armed rebel groups began to stage attacks against police and supporters of President Aristide in various Haitian cities. By the end of the month, the rebels controlled nearly half of Haiti and most of its large cities, with the exception of Port-au-Prince, the capital and largest city. Both the United States and France attempted to intervene in the growing crisis by proposing that Aristide share power with the political opposition. But as the proposal was being considered, the armed rebel groups advanced on Port-au-Prince and on February 29 Aristide resigned and was flown to the Central African Republic. Also in early February 2004, at the request of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the DND began planning for an operation to assist DFA efforts to evacuate Canadians and other nationals from Haiti. Designated operation PRINCIPAL, it involved four CC-130 Hercules aircraft from 8 Wing in Trenton, and more than 100 CF personnel evacuating more than 350 personnel and delivering Red Cross supplies. Following the departure of Aristide, Haiti\u2019s chief justice of the Supreme Court, Boniface Alexandre, was sworn in as interim president. The new president moved quickly to request the urgent support of the international community to assist in restoring peace and security in Haiti, and to further the constitutional political process that was under way. Subsequently, on 29 February 2004 the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1529 (2004) establishing for a three-month period the United Nations Multinational Interim Force (MIF). Their mandate was to contribute to a secure and stable environment in Haiti, facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance, assist the Haitian police and Coast Guard, and to coordinate their efforts with the OAS Special Mission to prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian situation.

By the end of March, Canada had deployed the main body of Task Force Haiti under the command of LCol J.P. Davis. The Task Force consisted of a single company group from the 2nd Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment (2 RCR) located in Gagetown, New Brunswick; six CH-146 Griffon helicopters from 430 Tactical Helicopter Squadron out of Valcartier, Quebec; a National Command Element that linked the Chief of the Defence Staff in Ottawa with Task Force Haiti; and a National Support Element responsible for delivering centralized administrative and logistics support to the Task Force, bringing the total number of personnel to approximately 500. Op HALO\u2019s original mandate was to deploy for 90 days and, in addition to the UN mandate, was to set conditions for a successful transition of MIF to International follow-on forces. In late May 2004, Operation HALO\u2019s mandate was extended a further 60 days beyond its initial 90\u2013day term, to permit Task Force Haiti to assist in the transition to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) from the Multinational Interim Force (MIF).

Up to 800,000 people were in need of assistance \u2013 10 percent of the population. In response, the Canadian Government authorized the Canadian Forces to provide assistance. A warning order was issued on 10 September, advising various CF units that they may be required to assist in Haiti. At the request of the Haitian prime minister and the World Food Programme the CF was asked to assist in delivering aid to the southern part of the country. HMCS St. John\u2019s, already deployed in the Caribbean on an anti-drug operation, was redeployed to the area. An operation order, issued on 17 September, gave the mission the name Operation HORATIO.\n\nThe Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) was placed on stand-by while a reconnaissance team deployed to the island on 9 September to determine if the DART could be effectively employed. Staff from the Joint Headquarters Kingston supported by the four Canadian officers who were in Haiti as part of Operation Hamlet (in support of the UN\u2019s MINUSTAH), helped coordinate efforts on the ground with other government departments from Canada, the Government of Haiti and the WFP. At the same time, military engineers working on a reconstruction project in Jamaica were redeployed to Haiti where at least six key bridges had been destroyed.\n\nWhile in Haiti, HMCS St. John\u2019s would load supplies in Port-au-Prince and then sailed to the southern peninsula of the country. The first load of 95.3 tons was loaded by hand with sailors and local residents standing side-by-side passing sacks of food along the jetty and into and onto the ship. The hangar deck and breezeways, in fact almost every accessible area, was stacked with bags. Cranes later assisted subsequent reloading efforts. Once at the destination the ship would anchor offshore while the embarked Sea King flew loads ashore. The Sea King proved very useful as it was able to reach communities for which no other means of transport were available, in the process flying over 300 cargo loads. By the time the operation concluded, St. John\u2019s had made four round trips, delivering more than 467 metric tons of rice, corn-soya meal, bottled water, water purification tablets and other relief supplies to nine communities over a 13-day period.\u00a0\n\nBy 25 September the WFP advised that they now had sufficient sealift capability and helicopters in place to take over the efforts of the Canadian mission.

The initial CF personnel on the ground conducted damage assessments, creating a list of what aid was required. Military engineers from 1 Construction Engineering Unit were asked to reconstruct the water and power systems in the central part of the island. The first task was clearing the roads and power lines of all the fallen trees. Personnel from 2 Combat Engineer Regiment, assisted by other specialists, set about restoring the water system. One group deployed to the village of Duckenfield Hall at the eastern end of the island, chlorinated the water from wells, and delivered it in trucks to surrounding villages. The second team went to Black River on the western end of the island and drew water from a river, purified it and then distributed it.

On 27 March 1990, the Council, by its Resolution 650 (1990), authorized, on a contingency basis, an enlargement of the mandate of ONUCA and the addition of armed personnel to its strength in order to enable it to play a part in the voluntary demobilization of the Nicaraguan Resistance. On 20 April 1990, following the signing by the Nicaraguan parties of a complex series of agreements relating to the voluntary demobilization of the Nicaraguan Resistance in Nicaragua, the Security Council, by its Resolution 653 (1990), decided to expand ONUCA\u2019s mandate to include the additional tasks of monitoring the ceasefire and separation of forces, and the demobilization process. After the completion of the demobilization process in June/July 1990, ONUCA continued to implement its original tasks and contribute to the peace efforts in the region.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " Throughout the 1970s, civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua not only escalated but also became intertwined as guerrilla forces used surrounding countries to launch their attacks and, sometimes, to find safe haven. Such cross-border operations in support of internal, civil wars threatened to disrupt the entire region. In 1983, the governments of Columbia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela -the Contadora Group- began to seek ways of reaching a negotiated peace. Their efforts failed, but they nevertheless laid the ground-work for the five Central American nations to seek an agreement amongst themselves to try to reduce tensions. Eventually, on 7 August 1987, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua signed the Esquipulas II Agreement, named after the city in Guatemala where it was signed. Based on an initial draft by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, the agreement did not declare a cease-fire but instead asked each nation to respect the sovereignty of its neighbours and their right to find their own solutions to their own problems; to encourage the growth of democracy through free elections; and to assist in the return of refugees and displaced persons. In addition, each signatory pledged to neither aid nor offer safe haven to irregular forces using its territory to attack others. The UN Secretary-General had been kept abreast of the negotiations, and once the agreement spelled out a concrete time-table the United Nations was ready to provide assistance in verifying compliance. The Grupo de Observadores de las Naciones Unidas en Centroam\u00e9rica (ONUCA \u2013 United Nations Observer Group in Central America) was authorized through Security Council Resolution 644 on 7 November 1989. To carry out its mandate, teams of observers would require vehicles for road patrols, helicopters for flights over the more difficult terrain, and patrol boats for operations in the Gulf of Fonseca and other coastal regions. The Chief Military Observer (CMO) and an advance party arrived in Tegucigalpa, Honduras on 3 December, to set up the ONUCA headquarters. The CMO and his staff quickly visited all five countries to set up regional headquarters and the verification centres from which mobile teams (comprising up to ten UNMOs) would deploy. Smaller operational posts were also created in forward areas where most allegations of non-compliance were made. Because these were border regions with difficult terrain and few good roads, the UNMOs relied upon the local population for their knowledge of roads and tracks, and upon helicopters to conduct observation flights. When they observed incidents of non-compliance, or received complaints, they would inform the offending party or government, request cooperation in undertaking further investigation, and then send their findings to all concerned. They also maintained close contact with guerrilla groups in order to build trust, pass on information, and, most importantly, ensure their own security: in most cases there had been no formal cease-fire between governments and the guerrillas they were fighting (to parallel those between the five states) and as the UNMOs attempted to resolve disputes at the state-to-state level it was essential that they be known to anyone whose paths they crossed. ONUCA\u2019s mandate was enlarged soon after it was established. On 12 March 1990, following the Nicaraguan elections, the Nicaraguan government and the Government-elect requested UN assistance in the demobilization of Nicaraguan guerrillas. ONUCA would create assembly points, verify their demobilization, and guarantee their security before the guerrillas were given civilian clothes and allowed to return to their homes. On 27 March, the Security Council agreed to this request, approving the Secretary-General\u2019s plan for ONUCA\u2019s involvement. Almost half of ONUCA\u2019s UNMOs were sent to Nicaragua to support guerrilla demobilization there \u2013 as was a Venezuelan infantry battalion. The first guerrillas were demobilized on 16 April, and the process, which involved 19,000 guerrillas in Nicaragua and a further 2,700 in Honduras, was completed by 5 July. ONUCA was then able to return to its original task of verifying compliance, patrolling areas of potential violations, and investigating complaints. Although they did not have the authority to prevent border crossings by armed personnel it was hoped that their presence would deter such activities. Given the willingness of the five governments to live up to the terms of the Esquipulas Agreement, the presence of the UNMOs was largely a success, and on 5 November it was possible to reduce ONUCA\u2019s strength to 158. Continued progress in stabilizing the situation allowed the Security Council to further reduce ONUCA to 132 while it extended its mandate to 30 April 1992 in the expectation of even greater success. This timetable was overtaken by events once El Salvador reached an agreement with the guerrillas it had been fighting. Resolution of that civil war promised to bring even more stability to the region and, as a result, on 20 May 1991 Security Council Resolution 693 approved the formation of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) to oversee the peace accord there. Subsequently, on 16 January 1992 the Security Council approved the transfer of all remaining ONUCA personnel to ONUSAL. That occurred on 24 January 1991, thereby bring ONUCA formally to an end.", "Name": "SULTAN", "Date": "12 December 1989 - 24 January 1992", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " ONUCA was established by Security Council Resolution 644 (1989) of 7 November 1989. The Group's mandate was to conduct on-site verification of compliance by the Governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua with their security undertakings contained in the Esquipulas II Agreement.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada began to prepare for ONUCA in October 1989, when warning orders were issued and staff checks made to identify likely candidates for deployment. The UN\u2019s formal request came on 3 December, and once the government had accepted the invitation the tasking order was sent on 12 December under the designation Operation SULTAN. The CF contingent would comprise thirty-six UN Military Observers (UNMOs) and eight CH-139 Jet Ranger helicopters supported by eighty-four air and ground crew who would form No. 89 Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) Unit (Canadian). Twenty-three additional personnel would form the National Support Element (Cdn HQ) and communications elements, and three additional officers would serve in ONUCA headquarters. The total size of the Canadian Contingent ONUCA (CCONUCA) would be 146, with the UNMOs posted to ONUCA for a year, and the LOH personnel attached posted for six months. The first Canadians in theatre were the advance party of nine officers, who arrived on 3 December. A reconnaissance party deployed on 10 December, followed by the communications and Canadian HQ elements and four Jet Rangers and part of the 89 LOH personnel arrived on 23 and 26 February. Most of the thirty-six UNMOs arrived on 9 March 1990. The remaining 89 LOH personnel arrived by the end of the month, but the helicopter unit was to undergo a change. On 6 March, the UN asked Canada to replace four Jet Rangers with four CH-135 Twin Hueys, for their longer range and heavier lift capability. This was approved, the Hueys arriving between 27 and 29 March, and with that the unit name was changed to No. 89 Canadian Rotary Wing Aviation Unit (89 RWAU). Its role was to fly command, liaison, and observer missions during daylight hours only. CF Hercules from 436 Squadron were also to play a support role throughout the mission, flying to Tegucigalpa, Honduras twice a month until August 1990. Meanwhile, CF naval personnel conducted operations from patrol craft provided and manned by Argentina. Based in San Lorenzo, Honduras, these boats conducted coastal, ocean, and river patrols. The UN eventually increased the number of Canadian personnel in ONUCA headquarters to four, filling the positions of Senior Staff Officer (SSO) Air, Deputy SSO Air, Flight Plan Assistant and Senior Operations Officer. With the larger size of the helicopter unit (102 personnel), the Canadian contingent now had a strength of 165 personnel. Once ONUCA began to draw down, the UN asked Canada to withdraw 89 RWAU and all support personnel, leaving only 30 UNMOs in place The redeployment to Canada occurred between 27 November and 15 December 1990. 89 RWAU ceased all flying operations on 30 November, returning to Canada by CF Hercules. CF vehicles and other equipment, which had deployed to ONUCA by commercial transport aircraft, returned to Canada by sea. Seven UNMOs departed when ONUCA downsized again towards the end of the mission. When ONUCA ended on 17 January 1992, the 23 remaining Canadian UNMOs were transferred to the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL). Overall, about 350 personnel served with ONUCA, with two rotations of UNMOs and two rotations of personnel with 89 RWAU."}}, {"opName": "(Ecuador 1973)", "countryRegion": "Ecuador", "continent": "Central America", "startDate": "1973-04-01", "endDate": "1973-04-30", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/central-america/ecuador-1973.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Ecuador 1973", "International Mission Name": "Ecuador 1973", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Central America", "Location": "Ecuador", "Mission Date": "1 April 1973 - 30 April 1973", "Mission Mandate": " To assist de Havilland Canada in selling aircraft to the Government of Ecuador.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " In April 1973, the Government of Canada authorized the Canadian Forces to assist de Havilland Canada in the company\u2019s efforts to sell DHC-5 Buffalo aircraft to Ecuador.

Its mandate was to verify the implementation of all agreements between the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional aimed at ending a decade-long civil war. The agreements involved a cease-fire and related measures, reform and reduction of the armed forces, creation of a new police force, reform of the judicial and electoral systems, observance of human rights, and land tenure reform as well as other economic and social issues. After the armed conflict had been formally brought to an end in December 1992, ONUSAL verified elections, which were carried out successfully in March and April 1994. ONUSAL tasks as set out in Resolution 693 included actively monitoring the human rights situation in El Salvador and investigating and reporting on specific cases of alleged human rights violations.\u00a0\n\nOn 14 January 1992, the Security Council enlarged the mandate of ONUSAL with Resolution 729. The mandate now included the verification and monitoring of the implementation of \u201call the agreements once these are signed\u201d at Mexico City between the Government of El Salvador and FMLN. In particular this included the Agreement on the Cessation of the Armed Conflict and the Agreement on the Establishment of a National Civil Police.\u00a0\n\nBy Resolution 832 of 27 May 1993, the Security Council decided to enlarge ONUSAL's mandate to include observation of the electoral process, and requested the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to this effect.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " Of the Central American nations wracked by civil war in the 1980s, perhaps none suffered as much as El Salvador, where more than 80,000 people were killed between 1979 and 1991. While there had been some guerrilla activity in El Salvador in the 1960s and 1970s, the level and intensity of violence escalated and broadened following a 1979 coup d\u2019etat which promised widespread reform but could not deliver quickly enough to satisfy all parties. Given continuing human rights abuses, dissatisfaction with the government mounted, and in January 1980 a number of opposition groups formed a common front under the name Coordinadora Revolucionaria de las Masas (CRM \u2013 Revolutionary Coordinator of the Masses). Two other groups joined the CRM in October 1980 to form the Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN \u2013 Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front), a coordinating body for five guerrilla groups. The FMLN launched an offensive against the regime in the cities of El Salvador in January 1981. This was defeated, forcing the FMLN to take their fight to the rural areas and operate from neighbouring countries.\u00a0\n\nWith violence extending throughout most of Central America, the Contadora peace initiative was launched, but eventually failed. However, ideas and proposals advanced during the Contadora process became part of the Esquipulas II peace agreement, signed in August 1987 in which, among other things, the Central American nations agreed to respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and to reduce their own, internal, human rights abuses. In part as a result of Esquipulas II, and in part because the civil war was becoming drawn out, the Salvadoran government and the FMLN began negotiations in September 1989. That the two sides were talking did not bring an end to the violence \u2013 2,000 people were killed in November alone \u2013 but the work of ONUCA, the overarching UN presence in Central America, was having an effect on the guerrillas\u2019 use of neighbouring countries and that had a helpful effect on the El Salvador situation.\u00a0\n\nIn July 1990, the government and FMLN finally signed an Agreement on Human Rights and requested UN assistance. Although it took some time, the Security Council created the Misi\u00f3n de Observadores de las Naciones Unidas en El Salvador (ONUSAL- United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador) on 20 May 1991 through Resolution 693. The mandate was to verify that both parties were complying with the Agreement on Human Rights and to investigate any allegation of breaches. Fifteen military observers, including one from Canada, deployed in early July to serve as liaison between the two sides and with ONUCA.\u00a0\n\nThe apparent stability and the desire of both sides to end the conflict produced the Act of New York on 31 December 1991, after two weeks of negotiations at UN headquarters. It incorporated all previous agreements and also indicated that the final Peace Agreement would be signed in Mexico City on 16 January 1992. The Security Council supported the enlargement of ONUSAL\u2019s mandate, unanimously voting for Resolution 729 on 14 January. ONUSAL now had three divisions: a Human Rights Division, a Police Division and a Military Division.\u00a0\n\nThe Human Rights Division had already been initiated under Resolution 693 to monitor human rights. The Police Division was created to overhaul the civilian police in El Salvador and creating and training the new National Civil Police.\u00a0\n\nThe Military Division was responsible for verifying that all fighting had ceased, that Salvadoran armed forces returned to their barracks, and that FMLN forces assembled in UN-created \u201cdesignated locations\u201d. The FMLN forces were required to remain in these designated locations, while Salvadoran military forces were excluded from them. FMLN forces could only leave these areas with an ONUSAL pass and an ONUSAL escort. Once in the designated locations, the FMLN troops would be counted, demobilized and reintegrated into society. ONUSAL would then destroy all weapons, while the FMLN had to declare and destroy all weapons in arms caches. ONUSAL observers also had to verify that the government had eliminated its death squads. The Military Division also helped coordinate and control the clearing of 425 mine fields.\u00a0\n\nThe greater part of the 372 UNMOs for the Military Division arrived in January 1992, including personnel who had transferred from ONUCA to ONUSAL when ONUCA terminated. After the assembly of FMLN forces and the return of government forces to their barracks had been completed in February and March, the number of UNMOs was reduced to 224. The timetable for demobilization was retarded, however, by political developments, most particularly over the issue of land distribution. By 15 December 1992, after assistance from the UN to resolve outstanding issues, the conflict between the Salvadoran government and the FMLN was formally declared to have terminated. This allowed ONUSAL headquarters to further reduce the Military Division.\u00a0\n\nThe Military Division nevertheless remained busy. Mine clearance was a consistent and continuing task, while there were also FMLN arms caches to investigate, especially after one exploded in Managua, Nicaragua, on 23 May. The peace process was not derailed by this incident and a date was set for the first elections involving the FMLN. ONUSAL\u2019s mandate was accordingly expanded. Although there were some irregularities in the 20 March 1994 elections, they were not significant enough to nullify the results. Further Presidential run-offs were held on 24 April.\u00a0\n\nWith elections complete and the FMLN and paramilitary forces demobilized, ONUSAL began reducing its strength. The mandate was extended one last time to 30 April 1995 in order to allow ONUSAL to assist in institution-building, such as supporting the parliament, the national police and the Supreme Court. Although there remained problems within El Salvador when the ONUSAL mandate lapsed, ONUSAL was successful in ending the civil war.", "Name": "MATCH", "Date": "1 July 1991 - 31 August 1994", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canadian participation in ONUSAL was named Operation MATCH. The first Canadian Forces officer arrived in July 1991, at the very start of the mission. Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Morris joined the Human Rights division as the military liaison officer. He went on to serve as ONUSAL Deputy Chief Military Advisor, Chief of Operations at a regional headquarters, but more significantly, was called upon to provide technical assistance during the final negotiations between the FMLN and the government of El Salvador in December 1991. He would play an important role in the New York Agreements. CF participation increased on 17 January 1992 when the remaining twenty-three Canadian members of ONUCA were transferred to ONUSAL. At the request of the UN, Canada provided an additional thirty officers to ONUSAL within a week, giving it the second largest number of UNMOs within the mission. They served mainly in El Salvador on cease-fire verification duties, and when this work was completed, fourteen of the ex-ONUCA officers returned to Canada in early March. The thirty augmentees followed later in the month. That left the Canadian contingent with eleven UNMOs, reduced to ten when LCol Morris retired in July.\u00a0\n\nThe next rotation of Canadian UNMOs came in August 1992 and comprised nine officers, two of whom had been augmentees in January. Eight of the former ONUCA UNMOs also left at that time, reducing Canada\u2019s overall ONUCA contingent to eight. (Its commander would now be the Canadian Forces Attach\u00e9 in Mexico City.) Two UNMOs were subsequently assigned to UNPROFOR, in the former Yugoslavia, on a temporary basis for eight weeks beginning 27 October, reflected the broad scope of Canada\u2019s peacekeeping efforts in these years. With further reductions in ONUSAL coming in January 1993, the services of six Canadian UNMOs were no longer required, and six volunteered to transfer to the United Nations Mission in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). When two UNMOs were repatriated to Canada and another transferred to the United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II), the Canadian contingent fell to two.\u00a0\n\nThe final Canadian ONUSAL rotation occurred in August 1993, when two officers who had previously served with ONUCA arrived. They remained for their one-year tour, and when they departed in August 1994 Canadian participation in ONUSAL came to an end.\u00a0\n\nDuring their participation in ONUSAL, Canadian officers held a large number of key appointments, including Chief of Staff, two chiefs of operations at regional headquarters and one at a verification centre, commanders of GOM, and two Deputy Operations Officer at ONUSAL headquarters. The main task of the UNMOs, of course, was observation \u2013 the straightforward task of recording whether or not the two parties were complying with the accords. However, observation was supplemented by more difficult tasks such as meeting with local and factional leaders, setting up demobilization centres, patrol and escort duties and personnel documentation. They thus found themselves to be diplomats one day, policemen the next while maintaining a presence that would bring stability to an area or assisting in delivering aid."}}, {"opName": "(El Salvador 2001)", "countryRegion": "El Salvador", "continent": "Central America", "startDate": "2001-01-14", "endDate": "2001-01-16", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/central-america/el-salvador-2001.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "El Salvador 2001", "International Mission Name": "El Salvador 2001", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Central America", "Location": "El Salvador", "Mission Date": "14 January 2001 - 16 January 2001", "Canadian Task Force Mission Statement": " To airlift relief supplies to El Salvador after a major earthquake.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " The quiet of a late Saturday afternoon was broken on 13 January 2001 when a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck El Salvador.

Arbenz began a progressive regime that allowed labour unions and restored many of the older political parties, even allowing the Communist Party to exist. He was also active in promoting the independence of the nation, and supporting the peasants, by redistributing land. One of the companies affected was the American-based United Fruit Company, which had a virtual monopoly of Guatemalan fruit production, owned large tracts of the best land, had interests in railroads and electricity and controlled the country\u2019s only Atlantic port. United Fruit successfully lobbied the Eisenhower regime to remove Arbenz. Giving some support to American decision-makers was the fact that Arbenz had bought Soviet-designed weapons from Czechoslovakia, an act that suggested to some in Washington that Arbenz was leaning towards Communism. As a result, the CIA launched Operation PBFORTUNE. Planning for the operation had begun in 1951; however, the plan was not activated until December 1953. In May 1954, the United States Navy with an embarked Marine Corps Battalion Landing Team began operations off Honduras under the pretext of protecting Honduras from a possible Guatemalan invasion. On 18 June, the forces of Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas, an exiled Guatemalan officer chosen by the Central Intelligence Agency to lead an insurrection, invaded Guatemala from El Salvador and Honduras. The roughly 480 guerrillas were ill-equipped and \u2013trained, and were no match for the 5,000 strong Guatemalan army. Soundly defeated, the invasion was on the verge of collapse when on 27 June Arbenz resigned. On receiving reports that the US Marines were landing in Honduras in preparation for an invasion of Guatemala and fearing that his own officers would join Armas, Arbenz chose to resign and proceed into exile. In the 11 days after his resignation, five successive military juntas occupied the Presidential palace. Guatemala began its descent from a nascent democracy into a military dictatorship engaged in human rights abuses and a counter-insurgency war that killed over 140,000 people.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " With the political instability after Arbenz\u2019 resignation and the fear that fighting would commence in the major cities, on 28 June 1954 the Department of External Affairs requested the RCAF have an aircraft stand-by in case the decision was made to evacuate Canadians from Guatemala. Any such effort would have been made in conjunction with the United States, and would have been initiated with the commencement of an American evacuation. The contingency plans remained in place until 5 July, at which time External Affairs indicated the plan could be abandoned.

Its mandate was to conduct verification of human rights and institution-building activities in Guatemala. This was primarily a civilian and humanitarian mission. When the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) signed a cease-fire (Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire) in Oslo on 4 December 1996, the Security Council created a military observer mission through Resolution 1094 on 20 January 1997. The military observers\u2019 mandate included observation of a formal cessation of hostilities, the separation and concentration of the respective forces of forces, and the disarmament and demobilization of URNG combatants in assembly points specifically prepared for this purpose. Civil war was practically the normal state of affairs in Guatemala for 36 years. It was a bloody conflict with both sides committing human rights violations against combatants and civilians. In the end, the conflict pitted the left-wing Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG \u2013 Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity) against a right-wing military dictatorship and later an elected government.\u00a0\n\nThe URNG was created in February 1982 as an amalgamation of four leftist groups fighting the Guatemalan government, the oldest of which dated back to 1962, although political violence had begun two years before. These groups and the URNG attacked government and military installations and set-up \u201ccollection\u201d posts on roads to collect money. They also used \u201cwar taxes\u201d, collected from the peasants, as another means of supporting their activities.\u00a0\n\nBy 1966, the government had created counter-insurgency organizations that included \u201cscorched-earth\u201d campaigns as part of its operations to eliminate support for the revolutionaries. In 1981, the military dictatorship began to force farmers to join in Civil Defence Patrols, and to act as informers and enforcers for the military. Those who did not suffered harassment and in some cases disappeared.\u00a0\n\nWith political violence in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, there was considerable impetus by the mid-1980s to establish a meaningful peace that would bring an end to cross-border operations and sanctuaries. In 1989, the URNG and the civilian government (elected in 1986) signed an accord in Oslo to start negotiations. This did not, however, end the violence. In 1994, the URNG and the government signed a series of accords: To support these accords, the UN General Assembly passed resolution A/RES/48/267 on 19 September 1994. This created the Misi\u00f3n de Verificaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas en Guatemala (MINUGUA \u2013 United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala). More than 250 human rights monitors, legal experts and police were deployed throughout the country in a process designed to reduce the violence while negotiations for a more permanent peace agreement continued.\u00a0\n\nIn January 1996, Alvaro Arzu assumed the Presidency. One if his goals was to create a lasting peace. Both sides suspended hostilities in March. By December, an agreement was reached with the URNG, formalized with the Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire, signed in Oslo on 4 December 1996 and the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace (Peace Accord) signed in Guatemala City on 29 December. As part of the Peace Accord, the URNG guerrillas would demobilize in the first half of 1997, in an operation to be verified by UN military observers. Accordingly, the Security Council passed Resolution 1094 on 20 January 1997, creating a military observer component to MINUGUA. With these agreements, the civil war that had killed over 200,000 Guatemalans was over.\u00a0\n\nBefore the UN mission was initiated, the URNG provided information on its 3,570 personnel to be demobilized, and on its military equipment inventory and the location of mines. The Guatemalan military provided lists of which units were to redeploy to bases. The first UN military observers deployed to six verification sites on 21 February 1997 and began operations on 3 March 1997. A total of 132 military observers and 13 medical personnel from 16 nations participated.\u00a0\n\nThe separation of forces was conducted by creating an inner security zone and an outer coordination zone around each URNG assembly point. Guatemalan army units could not enter the security zone while police units could only do so after consulting with the MINUGUA military observers. As URNG guerrillas arrived at the assembly points, they turned over their weapons, including explosives and mines, to the military observers.\u00a0\n\nIn all, MINUGUA military observers demobilized and issued temporary identification cards to 2,928 URNG combatants plus additional identification cards to URNG personnel who did not have to assemble. Over 535,000 weapons and rounds of ammunition were transferred to the military observers. The military observers also participated in the clearing of 378 mines, identified by the URNG, although this assistance was not part of the military observers\u2019 mandate.\u00a0\n\nThe completion of the MINUGUA military observer mandate occurred on 14 May 1997 when the Chief Military Observer handed over former URNG weapons and equipment to the Minister of the Interior. The human rights and institution-building portion of the mandate continued.\u00a0\n\nThe transition to a peaceful Guatemala was not without problems. Bishop Juan Gerardi was murdered in April 1998 after a report that he had been commissioned to prepare indicated that the Guatemalan military had been responsible for murder and human rights violations. Small paramilitary groups, both former URNG and former military, continued to conduct politically motivated attacks that threatened to destabilize the success of the Peace Accord. The poverty of the country also resulted in armed groups conducting robberies and extortion. MINUGUA\u2019s assistance in creating a national police force was one invaluable means towards reducing these problems.\u00a0\n\nAs stability returned to Guatemala, the requirement for MINUGUA was reduced. The mandate was therefore allowed to lapse in December 2004.", "Name": "VISION", "Date": "31 January 1997 - 25 May 1997", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canadian Forces participation in MINUGUA\u2019s military observer component was given the name Operation VISION. The order for the mission was issued on 31 January 1997, although planning for the mission predated this by several months. Staff checks identified 17 Spanish-speaking personnel, of whom 15 were selected to deploy. Personnel for the Canadian Contingent in Guatemala (CCIG) arrived in Guatemala on 15 February, the Commanding Officer having arrived on 9 February. After one week period of training, they deployed to the assembly areas. CCIG personnel were assigned in teams of two to each of the six assembly areas. The living conditions were described as \u201cspartan\u201d with some assembly areas lacking running water, electricity and sufficient tents when the CCIG arrived, but what made the conditions tolerable was the positive outlook of most URNG guerrillas towards a permanent cease-fire.\u00a0\n\nThe busiest period for the observer teams was during the period of assembly. Personnel arriving for demobilization had to be confirmed against URNG lists, weapons had to be collected and access to the assembly areas controlled.

Its mandate was to conduct verification of human rights and institution-building activities in Guatemala. This was primarily a civilian and humanitarian mission.\n\nWhen the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) signed a cease-fire (Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire) in Oslo on 4 December 1996, the Security Council created a military observer mission through Resolution 1094 on 20 January 1997. The military observers\u2019 mandate included observation of a formal cessation of hostilities, the separation and concentration of the respective forces of forces, and the disarmament and demobilization of URNG combatants in assembly points specifically prepared for this purpose.", "Mission Notes": " Civil war was practically the normal state of affairs in Guatemala for 36 years. It was a bloody conflict with both sides committing human rights violations against combatants and civilians. In the end, the conflict pitted the left-wing Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG \u2013 Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity) against a right-wing military dictatorship and later an elected government. The URNG was created in February 1982 as an amalgamation of four leftist groups fighting the Guatemalan government, the oldest of which dated back to 1962, although political violence had begun two years before. These groups and the URNG attacked government and military installations and set-up \u201ccollection\u201d posts on roads to collect money. They also used \u201cwar taxes\u201d, collected from the peasants, as another means of supporting their activities.\u00a0\n\nBy 1966, the government had created counter-insurgency organizations that included \u201cscorched-earth\u201d campaigns as part of its operations to eliminate support for the revolutionaries. In 1981, the military dictatorship began to force farmers to join in Civil Defence Patrols, and to act as informers and enforcers for the military. Those who did not suffered harassment and in some cases disappeared.\n\nWith political violence in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, there was considerable impetus by the mid-1980s to establish a meaningful peace that would bring an end to cross-border operations and sanctuaries. In 1989, the URNG and the civilian government (elected in 1986) signed an accord in Oslo to start negotiations. This did not, however, end the violence.\u00a0\n\nIn 1994, the URNG and the government signed a series of accords:\u00a0\n To support these accords, the UN General Assembly passed resolution A/RES/48/267 on 19 September 1994. This created the Misi\u00f3n de Verificaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas en Guatemala (MINUGUA \u2013 United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala). More than 250 human rights monitors, legal experts and police were deployed throughout the country in a process designed to reduce the violence while negotiations for a more permanent peace agreement continued.\n\nIn January 1996, Alvaro Arzu assumed the Presidency. One if his goals was to create a lasting peace. Both sides suspended hostilities in March. By December, an agreement was reached with the URNG, formalized with the Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire, signed in Oslo on 4 December 1996 and the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace (Peace Accord) signed in Guatemala City on 29 December. As part of the Peace Accord, the URNG guerrillas would demobilize in the first half of 1997, in an operation to be verified by UN military observers. Accordingly, the Security Council passed Resolution 1094 on 20 January 1997, creating a military observer component to MINUGUA. With these agreements, the civil war that had killed over 200,000 Guatemalans was over.\n\nBefore the UN mission was initiated, the URNG provided information on its 3,570 personnel to be demobilized, and on its military equipment inventory and the location of mines. The Guatemalan military provided lists of which units were to redeploy to bases. The first UN military observers deployed to six verification sites on 21 February 1997 and began operations on 3 March 1997. A total of 132 military observers and 13 medical personnel from 16 nations participated.\n\nThe separation of forces was conducted by creating an inner security zone and an outer coordination zone around each URNG assembly point. Guatemalan army units could not enter the security zone while police units could only do so after consulting with the MINUGUA military observers. As URNG guerrillas arrived at the assembly points, they turned over their weapons, including explosives and mines, to the military observers. In all, MINUGUA military observers demobilized and issued temporary identification cards to 2,928 URNG combatants plus additional identification cards to URNG personnel who did not have to assemble. Over 535,000 weapons and rounds of ammunition were transferred to the military observers. The military observers also participated in the clearing of 378 mines, identified by the URNG, although this assistance was not part of the military observers\u2019 mandate.\n\nThe completion of the MINUGUA military observer mandate occurred on 14 May 1997 when the Chief Military Observer handed over former URNG weapons and equipment to the Minister of the Interior. The human rights and institution-building portion of the mandate continued. The transition to a peaceful Guatemala was not without problems. Bishop Juan Gerardi was murdered in April 1998 after a report that he had been commissioned to prepare indicated that the Guatemalan military had been responsible for murder and human rights violations. Small paramilitary groups, both former URNG and former military, continued to conduct politically motivated attacks that threatened to destabilize the success of the Peace Accord. The poverty of the country also resulted in armed groups conducting robberies and extortion. MINUGUA\u2019s assistance in creating a national police force was one invaluable means towards reducing these problems. As stability returned to Guatemala, the requirement for MINUGUA was reduced. The mandate was therefore allowed to lapse in December 2004.", "Operation QUARTZ": " 1 June 1998 - 15 November 2004\n\nAt the end of Operation VISION, DND was asked by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to examine the possibility of providing two Spanish-speaking officers for the human rights aspect of MINUGUA. This was eventually approved and the first Canadian liaison officer, on what was named Operation QUARTZ, deployed on June 1998, joining five members of the RCMP.\n\nThe primary role of the military liaison officer was to act as a liaison between the UN employees and the Guatemalan military. Also included in his duties was ensuring that the government and former rebels lived up to the terms of the various accords, and investigating human rights violations. One area of concern was whether the Civil Defence Patrols were regrouping, a distinct possibility as some guerrillas and some military personnel refused to accept the Peace Accord and continued a low-level campaign, mostly criminal in nature.\n\nFrom June 1998 until the mission ended in December 2000, four military officers served with MINUGUA. The first two were on six-month tours, the last two on one-year tours. The last tour was cut short when the UN ended MINUGUA on 15 November 2004.\n"}}, {"opName": "(Honduras 1974)", "countryRegion": "Honduras", "continent": "Central America", "startDate": "1974-09-27", "endDate": "1974-10-26", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/central-america/honduras-1974.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Honduras 1974", "International Mission Name": "Honduras 1974", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Central America", "Location": "Honduras", "Mission Date": "27 September 1974 - 26 October 1974", "Mission Mandate": "To airlift relief supplies to Honduras after Hurricane Fifi", "Mission/Operation Notes": " On 18 September, Hurricane Fifi hit Honduras.

Over the course of the next two weeks, this little depression would become one of the deadliest and most devastating hurricanes on record in the western hemisphere. As the depression moved westward it became a hurricane on the 24th. Hurricane Mitch then rapidly increased in strength, becoming a Category 5 storm. As Mitch approached Honduras, it slowed down. From the 27th to the 31st Mitch was either off the coast of Honduras, or over the Honduran landmass where it caused flash floods and mudslides. Battering itself against the land, Mitch weakened to a tropical depression, but gained strength as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico and on to Florida. In Honduras, Mitch killed an estimated 10,000 people, injured 11,000, left 12,000 missing and over 1.4 million homeless. More than 70,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, as were 92 bridges, while roads and rail lines suffered extensive damage. With the water and power infrastructure damaged and communications cut-off, millions of people were isolated without any source of food, fuel, medicine or water. Over half of all agriculture was also destroyed. Canada\u2019s response, ordered on 6 November, was Operation CENTRAL, the first deployment of the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART). Deployment started on 9 November and was completed by the 15th. Supporting DART was a headquarters element, a helicopter detachment, an Airfield Security Force and a Military Air Movements Section. Over one week, CF Hercules conducted 30 flights to deploy the DART, while a CF Airbus flew down humanitarian aid and Canadian media. The Canadian headquarters established itself at La Ceiba, a regional transportation and distribution hub. DART established itself at Soneguerra, a city close to the Rio Aguan Valley, one of the hardest hit areas of the country. Once on the ground, the headquarters element began coordinating DART\u2019s efforts with that of the Honduran Ministry of Health, local medical relief committees and the Standard Fruit Company. The headquarters Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) cell was soon busy matching aid providers with local agencies requiring assistance. DART\u2019s medical team soon discovered a problem once deployed \u2013 the ruined transportation infrastructure limited the number of people who could attend the team\u2019s clinic. The solution was to create smaller clinics in remote areas and to use the helicopters to transport medical staff to various locations, as well as to conduct medical evacuations. Over the course of the mission, the medical team treated over 7500 patients. The medical team also coordinated an insect counter-measures project with the Honduran Ministry of Health. The Helo Det, consisting of 79 individuals from 427 Squadron, operated four CH-146 Griffon helicopters from La Ceiba. Over the course of the operation, they flew 223 missions, transporting 782 people and delivering 180 tons of humanitarian aid. Besides building the Canadian camp, the engineers participated in 19 community rehabilitation projects. More importantly, the Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit provided clean water that was bagged by the engineers and then delivered to needy areas. The engineers also assisted in rebuilding roads and restoring water supplies. The Mobile Air Movements Section team, located at La Ceiba, unloaded over 700 tons in the first ten days, mostly DART equipment and supplies. After that they were busy unloading up to 200 tons of aid per day and establishing an effective distribution system. This was a vital role as international aid flooded into the country. The 30-man MP platoon provided security for the helicopters, having been so tasked as the Honduran government had expected looting after the disaster. The MPs used their off-duty time to clean and repair a local school. With the disaster-assistance phase completed, the Honduran and international focus became one of reconstruction. DART operations were concluded on 12 December. All personnel were redeployed to Canada by 23 December. Responsibilities were turned over to Honduran and non-governmental organizations and the Canadian International Development Agency. Overall, almost 300 CF personnel were deployed to Honduras."}}, {"opName": "(Nicaragua 1972)", "countryRegion": "Nicaragua", "continent": "Central America", "startDate": "1972-12-25", "endDate": "1972-12-27", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/central-america/nicaragua-1972.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Nicaragua 1972", "International Mission Name": "Nicaragua 1972", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Central America", "Location": "Nicaragua", "Mission Date": "25 December 1972 - 27 December 1972", "Canadian Task Force Mission Statement": " To deliver humanitarian assistance to Nicaragua", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was one of the jewels of Central America.

With the numbers continuing to increase at a rate of 14,000 per day, NATO initiated OPLAN 10414, Operation ALLIED HARBOUR, NATO\u2019s first humanitarian operation. Normally the purview of non-governmental organizations, these agencies were unable to cope with the nearly 500,000 refugees that flooded into Albania, leaving NATO the only organization capable of dealing with the expanding need.\u00a0\n\nIn support of this NATO operation, the Canadian government offered to provide two CC130 aircraft and the associated personnel and equipment for intra-theatre airlift of humanitarian supplies into Albania and Macedonia. Dubbed Operation MIKADO by the CF, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) led Canadian operation consisted of an airlift component and a camp construction component.\u00a0\n\nThe United Nations High Commission for Refugees NHCR Air Co-ordination Cell in Geneva, which consisted of LOG experts from UNHCR, and personnel seconded by NATO member states, collected and prioritized all humanitarian assistance requirements for both Albania and Macedonia. All national, civilian, military, and NATO, offered airlift capacity were matched with the prioritized list of requirements by this cell. As a result, on 9 April CF aircraft were tasked with flying to Bergen, Norway to airlift up to 500 metric tones of biscuits and canned fish into Skopje, Albania. Following the delivery of the final load of supplies, CIDA determined that Op MIKADO would not be required to carry out humanitarian airlift ops beyond the 17th of April. However, the dynamic nature of Canadian participation in ongoing NATO ops required that a capability be retained to respond tactically within Europe to unforeseen operational airlift requirements. To this end a minimal Air Lift Control Element (ALCE) was established from Op MIKADO personnel. Tasked with keeping abreast of the developing situation in the Balkans, it was able to respond on 12 hrs notice to tactical airlift requests in support of Task Force Albania (TFA) and ops within the Balkans area.\u00a0\n\nThe camp construction component consisted of a staff check to look at preliminary costing for the construction of a camp capable of supporting 5000 personnel through the Albanian winter. The camp would consist of sleeping accommodations for 5000 persons, ablution facilities, kitchen and messing, HQ facility for 250 personnel, camp support area, water purification and storage facilities, waste water treatment, power generation, roads, security, and fire fighting installation. Estimated time of construction was 50-60 days, at a cost of $19.2 - $38.4 million dollars, depending on which combination of civilian and military assets would complete the work. In the end, the requirement never materialized and no further action was taken.\u00a0\n\nThough Canada\u2019s participation ended early on, Operation ALLIED HARBOUR operated up until the end of August 1999, when on 1 September it handed over command to NATO-led KFOR Communication Zone West (COMMZ (W)) command. The NATO presence in Albania prevented Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic from destabilizing the country and was instrumental in sustaining the refugees. During its five months of operation, ALLIED HARBOUR was responsible for nearly 3,500 flights into the country moving more than 14,000 metric tones of supplies. It repaired 189 kilometers of road, and constructed 21 camps providing some 129,050 places. At the time of handover, planning had been completed for a further 120,550 places when the need ceased."}}, {"opName": "MACEDOINE", "countryRegion": "Armenia", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1988-12-12", "endDate": "1988-12-22", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/macedoine.html", "details": {"International Operation Name ": "Operation MACEDOINE", "International Mission Name ": "Operation MACEDOINE", "Mandating Organization ": "Government of Canada", "Region Name ": "Europe", "Location ": "Armenia", "Mission Date ": "12 December 1988 - 22 December 1988", "Mission Mandate ": "To deliver humanitarian aid to Armenia.", "Mission/Operation Notes ": " On December 7th, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.

The Russian Empire took over much of the area that is now Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1813. With the Russian Revolution of 1917, both areas declared independence and sought to control the mountainous (nagorno) Karabakh region in which both ethnic groups were represented. Their freedom was short-lived, however, as the Soviet Union asserted control over the region in 1923 and ended all thoughts of independence. As the Soviet Union began to come apart in the late 1980s, demonstrations against Azeri rule broke out in both Nagorno-Karabakh (N-K) and Armenia. In 1990, after violent incidents, Soviet forces moved into N-K and began to seek out Armenian paramilitary groups, with support from the Azeri militia. By September 1991, Moscow indicated its intention to pull out of N-K. Armenian militants increased their level of violence, in which 30,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the period between 1992 \u20131994.\u00a0\n\nThe fighting resulted in Armenian and Karabakhi forces creating a link between Armenia and N-K, occupation of most of N-K and parts of western Azerbaijan. Hundreds of thousands of Azeris fled, while the UN Security Council adopted resolutions calling for a cease-fire. The fighting continued until Russia arranged a cease-fire in May 1994; however, the situation remains tense.\u00a0\n\nEarly mediation attempts resulted in cease-fires that were usually broken within minutes of being signed. There was hope in 1992 when Armenia and Azerbaijan joined the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) - the predecessor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) - and a group of 11 nations within the CSCE, including Armenia and Azerbaijan, was created to assist in negotiations. However, the original \u201cMinsk Group\u201d, named for the location of its proposed first meeting, failed immediately when Armenia and Azerbaijan quarreled over terms of reference the Karabakhi Armenians pointing to Principle VIII of the Helsinki Final Act (the \u2018charter\u2019 of the OSCE) to substantiate their claim to self-determination and Azerbaijan citing Principle IV\u2019s guarantee of territorial integrity. Further complicating negotiations was the fact that Azerbaijan demanded negotiations with Armenia, while Armenia indicated that only the Karabakhi could speak for themselves.\u00a0\n\nRetaining the name of \u2018Minsk Group\u2019, the other nine members continued to work at finding a solution, resulting in a cease-fire being implemented in May 1994. At the same time the OSCE considered a small verification mission to assist in the maintenance of the cease-fire. Political developments soon escalated the level of proposed activity to an OSCE-led monitoring mission and security force. As this would have been the first OSCE force of this size, and the first deployed into such a hostile environment, Canada was approached to provide personnel to assist with the development of the mission. The OSCE created a High Level Planning Group (HLPG) on 20 December 1994, located in Vienna, to determine and plan the mounting of an OSCE peacekeeping mission in Nagorno-Karabakh. The HLPG was composed of military experts seconded from member nations. The mandate was to: The original mandate of the HLPG was to expire on 30 December 1995. Personnel began arriving in Vienna in March 1995, with familiarization training for the planning mission beginning on 20 March. A reconnaissance was conducted of the N-K area in the latter half of May. From this a basic framework for the size of the mission was developed and an understanding derived of the basic situation in which any OSCE peacekeeping mission would operate. This was presented to the Chairman-in Chief on 14 July 1995, and consisted of four options.\u00a0\n\nWhile the military planning reached a highly developed state, the local political will to allow a peacekeeping mission was more problematic and with no agreement in sight the mandate of the HLPG was therefore extended from 30 December 1995 to 30 June 1996. When no solution was forthcoming, most of the HLPG members returned to their home nations beginning in July 1996. The HLPG nevertheless continued to exist, with eight officers seconded from OSCE members. This slimmed-down organization was prepared to provide advice to the OSCE on military matters related to peacekeeping in N-K and to keep abreast of current military matters in the region.

In September 1995, approval was given for Canadian participation in the OSCE High Level Planning Group (HLPG) for Nagorno-Karabakh. Canadian participation was given the name Operation NYLON, and consisted of three staff officers. They operated under the name Canadian Contingent to the OSCE.\u00a0\n\nThe three officers arrived in Vienna in March 1995 for a one-year posting. The lieutenant colonel was to be employed in the operations cell, one major in the logistics cell and one major as the HLPG Chief Financial Officer. From 18 May to 1 June 1995, all three officers deployed to N-K as part of the HLPG reconnaissance mission.\u00a0\n\nIn December 1995, two of the Canadian officers were seconded to the OSCE mission in Bosnia created to support the recently-signed Dayton Accord and were sent to the OSCE planning secretariat in Vienna. Both would return to the HLPG, but when it became clear that there was no apparent solution to the N-K problem, the Canadian contingent Commander and Canadian Embassy recommended that Canadian participation should end with the expiry of the extended HLPG mandate. Approval for the termination of Op NYLON was given on 7 June 1996, with the three officers scheduled to depart Vienna on 15 July.\n"}}, {"opName": "JUMP MOAT", "countryRegion": "Belgium", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1957-12-02", "endDate": "1958-10-24", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/jump-moat.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation JUMP MOAT", "International Mission Name": "Operation JUMP MOAT", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Europe", "Location": "Belgium", "Mission Date": "2 December 1957 - 24 October 1958", "Canadian Task Force Mission Statement": " To ferry aircraft to Belgium and to No. 1 RCAF Air Division in Europe.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " With the stand-up of NATO and the emergence of the Cold War, Europe was seen as the next potential battleground, so much so that even the Korean War was seen as a diversion. Canada committed herself to providing 12 squadrons of aircraft as well as ground forces in an effort to deter attacks and defend Western Europe. The aircraft would be flown to Europe using the North Atlantic ferry route that had been developed during the Second World War by the RAF's Ferry Command. Leaving from Goose Bay or Gander in Newfoundland, aircraft would fly to Greenland, Iceland and on to Scotland and England. The first aircraft to make the flight were F-86 Sabres, on their way to create No. 1 Canadian Air Division. Under the name Operation LEAP FROG, three squadrons of Sabres would fly the route, trailed by a 426 Squadron North Star carrying servicing personnel. A total of four distinct operations were flown: As the CF-100 proved itself as an all weather night fighter, the decision was made to replace four squadrons of Sabres with four squadrons of Canucks. This would provide NATO with a more capable interception capability, as there was no all-weather or night fighter capability in Europe. The Canucks were flown to Europe under Operation NIMBLE BAT, and again 426 Squadron provided a North Star aircraft to carry support personnel for each stop-over. The timings for each of the four Nimble Bat operations are: The Canadair Sabre was constantly modified to maintain its edge as one of the best fighters of the era. As new Marks emerged off Canadair's production lines, these aircraft were ferried to Europe to replace the now dated aircraft. At the same time, T-33s for use by the Air Division and as Mutual Aid gifts to NATO members were also ferried across the Atlantic, under the name Operation RANDOM. The first operation began on 11 February 1954, ferrying new Sabre Vs, while the last mission, Random 30 commenced on 24 June 1957, with 24 Sabre Vis and six T-33s. In just over three years of ferrying, No. 1 Overseas Ferry Unit, supported by 426 Squadron, safely delivered more than 800 aircraft overseas. No. 1 OFU also brought aircraft back to Canada. With the introduction of the Mk VI Sabre, the now surplus Mk Vs were either donated to other NATO members, or brought back to Canada. HMCS Magnificent left the UK with 50 Sabres on 7 Nov 56; while No. 1 OFU completed two ferrying operations from east to west across the North Atlantic - Operations RANDOM WEST I and II, on 17-19 Oct 56 (20 Sabre Vs) and 17-20 Nov 56 (16 Sabre Vs). (These operations were also referred to as REVERSE RANDOM.) When Belgium purchased 53 Avro CF-100 Canucks, the RCAF delivered them in Operation JUMP MOAT. There were five missions under this op name, with the numbers 3 and 4 also bringing CF-100s to the Air Division and number 5 being solely Air Division aircraft. The need to transfer aircraft to Europe did not end with Operation Random. In 1958, the need to ferry T-33s to NATO members under the Mutual Aid agreement produced operation STAR FLIGHT, with eight T-33s going to Greece and 17 T-33s going to Turkey. The aircraft, accompanied by two North Stars from No. 426 Sqn, departed on 9 May and returned to Canada on 22 May. 1959 was to prove a very busy year for ferrying aircraft to Europe. On 9 June, 12 T-33s piloted by members of No. 129 Acceptance and Ferry Flight and escorted by a 426 Squadron North Star departed Goose Bay for No. 4 Wing as part of Operation SILVER DOZEN. They arrived safely at Baden-Sollingen on 15 June. A repeat of this operation was required in August, hence Operation SECOND SILVER DOZEN. This time, No. 129 AFF and No. 426 Sqn delivered 11 T-33s to No. 4 Wing. In September, Operation WESTERN WEAR ferried 22 T-33s to the Air Division, France, Greece, Portugal and Turkey. Pilots from No. 129 AFF were again accompanied by the familiar North Star from No. 426 Sqn, the operation starting 22 September and being completed with the return to Canada on 9 October. (This op was also referred to in RCAF files as Op Western Way.) Throughout the 1950s, the RCAF, under the authorization of the Government of Canada, provided aircraft to NATO allies under the Mutual Aid Agreement. In 1959, 19 Beech C-18 Expeditors were provided to France and another 6 to Portugal, flying to these countries under Operation BEECHFLIGHT. This operation started on 20 May and ended 4 June when the six Portuguese aircraft landed in that country. Each aircraft had a pilot and navigator, while a North Star from 426 Squadron carried the 12-man support section. Operation Western Weft and Western Weal were conducted in 1962, delivering aircraft to France and Greece respectively. On this occasion 40 T-33s and 10 Expeditors were given to France, and 10 T-33s to Greece. This operation was conducted in five separate missions between 17 April and 3 August. The RCAF also ferried aircraft inside aircraft. As CF-104 Starfighters were coming off the Canadair production line in Montreal, most were transported to Europe to equip No. 1 Air Division. These operations involved putting the CF-104 inside one of the newly acquired C-130 Hercules and flying it over in that manner. These operations, known as RHO DELTA, lasted from 1962 to 1965, ending when the last of the 185 CF-104s had been delivered.

In early 1992 the ongoing conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the Bosnian Serb siege of Sarajevo resulted in two operations. The Security Council authorized the creation of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), and a United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) request resulted in the UNHCR airlift of supplies to Sarajevo. Although the Security Council tasked UNPROFOR and later UN operations in Bosnia-Hercegovina with assisting the airlift, the Council was not involved in its creation.\n\nWith the onset of war in the former republics of Yugoslavia in 1991, the UNHCR was the lead agency for the delivery of food aid to refugees, and to villages and towns that were cut off from normal food supplies because of the fighting. Over 4 million people received aid, 2.7 million in Bosnia. Initially, this aid was delivered by road; however, as the extent of the war in Bosnia increased and as the Bosnian Serbs made it ever harder for humanitarian convoys to deliver aid, the UNHCR began to rely more upon the airlift of aid into various locales in Bosnia. The Bosnian Serbs found ways to cut off this means of resupply. Sarajevo and its environs with 440,000 people became cut off.\u00a0\n\nOn 5 June 1992, UNPROFOR brokered an agreement with the Bosnian Serbs that would allow UNHCR flights into Sarajevo. Although UN troops under Major-General Lewis MacKenzie arrived on 29 June, the Bosnians Serbs still controlled the airport with heavy weapons, anti-aircraft guns on its approaches, and troops within sniping range. Road access to Sarajevo was still very heavily hindered. The size of the airlift required to supply Sarajevo was beyond the capabilities of the UNHCR and its hired aircraft. The UNHCR thus turned to military partners for assistance.\n\nOn 3 July 1992, the UNHCR airlift into Sarajevo began with personnel from 21 nations participating. In the first half of the operation, flights into Sarajevo originated from Split and Zagreb in Croatia, Frankfurt, Germany and Ancona, Italy. In 1995 these were consolidated into Ancona to save money. The airlift was coordinated by the UNHCR in close co-operation with the participating nations and UNPROFOR, which provided security at Sarajevo airport.\n\nThe airlift was always vulnerable to interruption. It was suspended after NATO airstrikes against Serb targets on 5 August 1994; it resumed again on 22 August. It was suspended again on 21 November when the Serbs threatened the flights if NATO did not stop enforcing the \u201cno-fly\u201d zone over Bosnia. In March 1995, the airlift had to be scaled back 40 percent as the Bosnian Serbs were hindering deliveries from the airport to the city. The airlift ceased altogether on 8 April when heavy fighting around the airport made it too hazardous. The Serbs then cut off the supplies of natural gas, electricity and water in May and seriously hindered the delivery of aid by road. The airlift did not resume again until September 1995.\n\nIn the most serious incident, on 3 September 1992, an Italian Air Force G-222 transport was hit by a surface to air missile while 27 kilometres from Sarajevo airport. All four crewmen on board were killed. Over one hundred incidents were recorded where small arms fire was directed at the aircraft.\n\nOver the course of 3 \u00bd years, the airlift delivered over 160,677 tonnes of supplies into Sarajevo, including over 144,000 tonnes of food and 15,850 tonnes of medical supplies and equipment.

The detachment originally operated out of Zagreb, Croatia, but moved to Ancona, Italy in February 1993, although 426 Squadron occasionally flew out of Split in 1994 and 1995. The detachment consisted of one CC-130 Hercules and about 44 air and ground crew. The two aircrew rotated shifts as they were flying three flights a day, seven days a week. Each month a new rotation would arrive, with some personnel having more than seven tours and many having five and some eleven or more.

NATO supported this mandate through Operation SKY MONITOR. As a result of over 500 unauthorized flights in fewer than six months, coupled with the increasing belligerency of Bosnian-Serb forces on the ground, the Security Council passed resolution 816 on 31 March 1993 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The resolution reiterated the ban and extended the mandate of resolution 781, but also requested all member states to take \"all necessary measures in the airspace of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the event of further violations...\" After deliberations, the North Atlantic Council approved NATO's plan for implementing the resolution.

The eventual mission of the operation was: The NATO AEW aircraft that had been conducting air orbits over the Adriatic Sea and Hungary in support of Operation SKY MONITOR simply continued their missions under the new operation name. It took a while, however, for the UN's threat of force to be used. It was not until 28 February 1994 in fact, that the first violators were shot down. Six Bosnian-Serb aircraft dropped bombs on Bosnian territory, with the result that four were shot down by NATO aircraft. As the situation on the ground in Bosnia degenerated, the Security Council adopted resolutions 958 and 981 allowing the use of air strikes against ground targets. As a result, Bosnian-Serbs began to take UN soldiers as hostages and flaunt their disregard for the UN by attacking UN-declared Safe Areas. Despite occasional NATO attacks on Bosnian-Serb ground targets in support of the UN resolutions, the situation eventually reached the point where UN Commanders decided to launch Operation DELIBERATE FORCE, an attack on Bosnian-Serb military targets commencing 30 August 1995. Operation DENY FLIGHT involved a wide variety of aircraft including attack, electronic warfare, tankers and airborne early warning. On 15 December 1995, the Security Council passed resolution 1031, which terminated resolutions 781, 816, 824 and 936. This terminated the authority for Op DENY FIGHT. The North Atlantic Council agreed that the operation should be terminated and the air resources transferred to the Implementation Force for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Operation DECISIVE ENDEAVOUR, part of the NATO-led Operation JOINT ENDEAVOUR. On 20 December 1995, Operation DENY FLIGHT was terminated. Over the course of the operation, 100,420 sorties were flown. This included over 23,000 fighter sorties, 27,000 close air support and air strike sorties and more than 29,000 AEW and support sorties.

UNPROFOR's (sometimes referred to as UNPROFOR II) mandate continued only in Bosnia-Herzegovina. From March to November 1995, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina was dominated by three main developments. First, there was an unprecedented level of military activity accompanied by major movements of refugees. Second, both UNPROFOR and NATO used force against the Bosnian Serbs. And third, the United States-led peace initiative, together with a countrywide decrease in fighting in October and November, provided a solid opportunity for a political solution to the conflict.\nThroughout September and October a United Nations Special Envoy had conducted talks with members of the former Yugoslav republics. These talks led to the peace talks held in Dayton Ohio, and the eventual signing of the Dayton Peace Accord on 15 November 1995.\nUNPROFOR\u2019s mandate came to a close on 20 December 1995 in accordance with the provisions of the Dayton Peace Accord.

The initial force had been reduced over the years from 32,000 to 7,000 in June 2004. However, after eight years in the country, NATO considered that it was no longer required and that another organization should follow-up these successes. The European Union (EU), in the 2003 Thessaloniki Declaration, indicated that the Western Balkans were both central and significant to the EU. The EU thus agreed to send in a force and after a transition period, the European Union Force in Bosnia Herzegovina (EUFOR) took over on 2 December 2004. This new force was named Operation ALTHEA and was given the blessing of the United Nations Security Council with Resolution 1575 (2004) of 22 November 2004.\n\nEUFOR\u2019s mission is to ensure compliance with the Dayton Accord and to contribute to a safe and secure environment in Bosnia. Additionally, support is provided to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. These activities are performed in coordination with national agencies and other international agencies such as NATO.\n\nEven before EUFOR took over, its forces conducted operations in Bosnia. From 16 November to 20 December, EUFOR troops participated in Operation Harvest, a weapons collection effort in Mostar and environs. This was followed by operation Spring Clean which started in January 2005 and was an effort to detect and disrupt organized crime and corruption. Similar operation in support of EUFOR\u2019s mission continued throughout 2005 and into 2007.\n\nInitially, Op Althea had about 7,000 personnel, but that number had fallen to 2500 by August 2007. Despite the name, over ten non-EU nations have contributed forces, in addition to at least 24 EU members.\n\nCanada\u2019s participation in Op Althea continued from SFOR. With the change in organization, this participation was given a new name, Operation BRONZE. There were 85 personnel who made the transition from SFOR to EUFOR. On 9 February 2005, Operation BRONZE was divided into two distinct operations: Operation BRONZE for those part of the NATO Headquarters in Sarajevo, and Operation BOREAS for those who operated under the aegis of EUFOR.\u00a0\n\nThe 69 Operation BRONZE personnel operated with Liaison and Observation Teams (LOT) in Bihac, with Multinational Task Force (Northwest), a field humint team and a national support cell in Banja Luka, and a movement detachment in Zagreb, Croatia.

Working with local interpreters, they would visit communities to get a feel for what was happening in the area.\n\nThe Government of Canada expressed a desire, however, to reduce its commitment to EUFOR when a replacement nation could be found for the departing Canadian forces. With the second rotation of Op Boreas in September 2005, the mission was reduced to 11 persons restricted to the Liaison and Observation Teams in Bihac.

The Canadian contingent in UNPROFOR had created a theatre evacuation plan; however, a larger, more coordinated effort was required for all NATO forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Naval planning included some expenditures to prepare the allotted ships for Op Cobra. Equipment preparations were made - ships were to be \"fitted for\", but not \"fitted with\" various equipments required for the mission.

Both HMCS Preserver and HMCS Provider would carry the land forces equipment to the operations area. Supporting the ships would be seven CH-124 Sea Kings from 406, 423 and 443 Squadrons. Their role would be helicopter delivery service, surface surveillance, and liaison and communications support for the JFHQ. Modifications to the Sea Kings would include fitting them to carry a 5.56 calibre general purpose machine gun. Army planning consisted of building a battle group around 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.

At the beginning of the year the Croatian government announced that it would no longer support extensions to UNPROFOR's mandate inside Croatia. This resulted in the transformation of UNPROFOR into three separate, but interdependent, missions under the umbrella title of the United Nations Peace Forces (UNPF). The United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation (UNCRO) in Croatia was created as a smaller, less powerful peacekeeping mission to replace UNPROFOR inside Croatia. In accordance with the functions envisaged in the cease-fire agreement of 29 March 1994, UNCRO would: monitor the area between the forward troop deployment lines, verify that all weapons systems were deployed in accordance with the agreement, occupy checkpoints at all crossing-points specified in the agreement, and conduct liaison activities to ensure implementation of the agreement. To perform those functions fully UNCRO would have exclusive control of the area between forward troop deployment lines. It would establish static posts as well as carry out patrols on foot, by vehicle and by helicopter. UNCRO would also have full freedom of movement to monitor the deployment of troops and weapons systems. With Croatia's reclaiming by force of Western Slavonia and the Krajina region, the need for UN peacekeeping forces was clearly diminished. However, in Eastern Slavonia - the last Serb-controlled territory in Croatia - the mandate of UNCRO remained essentially unchanged, and with the aid of UN-sponsored talks, the government of Croatia and the Croatian Serb leadership agreed to resolve the issue through negotiation. On 12 November 1995, the two sides signed the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Barania and Western Sirmiun. With the signing of the Agreement, and passage of UNSCR 1037(1996) and 1038(1996), the mandate of UNCRO was allowed to terminate on 15 January 1996, being replaced by the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES), and United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP).", "Name": "HARMONY", "Date": "31 March 1995 - 17 October 1995", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Only one Canadian infantry battalion group served with UNCRO under the Canadian designation Operation HARMONY, Roto 6.

The Krajina region the R22eR BG had inherited was quiet in early April; however the Croats believed the presence of UN troops in Croatia only made the incorporation of the Serb Krajina region into the Croatian state more difficult to achieve. Following the Croatian government's announcement earlier in the year to terminate UNPROFOR's mandate, tensions between the Croatian government and the Krajina Serbs began to increase rapidly, and in May 1995 the Croatian Army launched an offensive against the Serb forces in Western Slavonia (UNCRO's Sector West). The Croats easily defeated the Serbs and reclaimed Croatian territory, which eventually led to the end of the UNCRO presence in the area. Throughout the early part of their rotation, the soldiers of 2 R22eR BG watched the tensions between the Serbs and Croats rise Sector South. Local units of the Krajina Serb military began to mobilize and the Canadians soon found themselves between two increasingly belligerent groups. However, open warfare did not immediately break out and by July the Canadians were involved in adjusting the boundaries of the territory they were responsible for patrolling and observing. In early August the Croatian Army attacked in the Krajina region and quickly defeated the Serbs. 2 R22eR BG was placed on the highest level of alert, but there was little they could do. Having been told to leave by the Croatian government, whose permission UNCRO troops required to remain in the country, the Canadians prepared to depart. The electronic warfare (EW) support being supplied to the Canadian Battle Group through Operation MEDUSA continued to provide two direction-finding detachments mounted in Bison vehicles. Each detachment included two linguists and provided search, interception, and Line of Bearing direction finding capabilities and remained active until the end of the tour.

In order to respond to those wishes, the Secretary-General proposed that UNPROFOR be replaced by three separate but interlinked peacekeeping operations. Each of the three operations would be headed by a civilian Chief of Mission and would have its own military commander. In view of the interlinked nature of the problems in the area, and in order to avoid the expense of duplicating existing structures, overall command and control of the three operations would be exercised by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and a Theatre Force Commander commanding the military elements of the Force under his authority. On 31 March 1995, the Security Council adopted three resolutions to restructure UNPROFOR, replacing it with operations in Croatia (UNCRO), Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNPROFOR), and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (UNPREDEP), with mandates extending initially until 30 Nov 1995.\u00a0\n\nKnown collectively as United Nations Peacekeeping Forces (UNPF), the headquarters were located in Zagreb, Croatia. The headquarters group then became known as United Nations Peacekeeping Forces Headquarters (UNPF-HQ). Canada\u2019s contribution to the UNPF-HQ was called Operation SPEAKER, and consisted of some 60 personnel who took over from the National Support Element (NSE) element that had supported the Canadian Contingent in Yugoslavia up to the end of UNPROFOR\u2019s mandate.\u00a0\n\nIn December of 1995 UNPF\u2019s mandate came to a close with the signing of the Dayton Peace Accord. The United Nations subsequently created five separate missions to continue the work begun under UNPF\u2019s mandate. In Bosnia, Implementation Force (IFOR) took over where UNPROFOR left off.

At the beginning of the year the Croatian government announced that it would no longer support extensions to UNPROFOR's mandate inside Croatia. This resulted in the transformation of UNPROFOR into three separate, but interdependent, missions under the umbrella title of the United Nations Peace Forces (UNPF). The United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation (UNCRO) in Croatia was created as a smaller, less powerful peacekeeping mission to replace UNPROFOR inside Croatia. In accordance with the functions envisaged in the cease-fire agreement of 29 March 1994, UNCRO would: monitor the area between the forward troop deployment lines, verify that all weapons systems were deployed in accordance with the agreement, occupy checkpoints at all crossing-points specified in the agreement, and conduct liaison activities to ensure implementation of the agreement. To perform those functions fully UNCRO would have exclusive control of the area between forward troop deployment lines. It would establish static posts as well as carry out patrols on foot, by vehicle and by helicopter. UNCRO would also have full freedom of movement to monitor the deployment of troops and weapons systems. With Croatia's reclaiming by force of Western Slavonia and the Krajina region, the need for UN peacekeeping forces was clearly diminished. However, in Eastern Slavonia - the last Serb-controlled territory in Croatia - the mandate of UNCRO remained essentially unchanged, and with the aid of UN-sponsored talks, the government of Croatia and the Croatian Serb leadership agreed to resolve the issue through negotiation. On 12 November 1995, the two sides signed the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Barania and Western Sirmiun. With the signing of the Agreement, and passage of UNSCR 1037(1996) and 1038(1996), the mandate of UNCRO was allowed to terminate on 15 January 1996, being replaced by the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES), and United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP).", "Name": "WALLEYE", "Date": "15 September 1995 - 17 October 1995", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Only one Canadian infantry battalion group served with UNCRO under the Canadian designation Operation HARMONY, Roto 6. (Operation HARMONY's previous 5 rotations and initial deployment were under the original UNPROFOR mandate). By mid-April 1995 the 2e Bataillon, Royal 22e R\u00e9giment, completed the handover from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment. The Krajina region the R22eR BG had inherited was quiet in early April; however the Croats believed the presence of UN troops in Croatia only made the incorporation of the Serb Krajina region into the Croatian state more difficult to achieve. Following the Croatian government's announcement earlier in the year to terminate UNPROFOR's mandate, tensions between the Croatian government and the Krajina Serbs began to increase rapidly, and in May 1995 the Croatian Army launched an offensive against the Serb forces in Western Slavonia (UNCRO's Sector West). The Croats easily defeated the Serbs and reclaimed Croatian territory, which eventually led to the end of the UNCRO presence in the area. Throughout the early part of their rotation, the soldiers of 2 R22eR BG watched the tensions between the Serbs and Croats rise Sector South. Local units of the Krajina Serb military began to mobilize and the Canadians soon found themselves between two increasingly belligerent groups. However, open warfare did not immediately break out and by July the Canadians were involved in adjusting the boundaries of the territory they were responsible for patrolling and observing. In early August the Croatian Army attacked in the Krajina region and quickly defeated the Serbs. 2 R22eR BG was placed on the highest level of alert, but there was little they could do. Having been told to leave by the Croatian government, whose permission UNCRO troops required to remain in the country, the Canadians prepared to depart. The electronic warfare (EW) support being supplied to the Canadian Battle Group through Operation MEDUSA continued to provide two direction-finding detachments mounted in Bison vehicles. Each detachment included two linguists and provided search, interception, and Line of Bearing direction finding capabilities and remained active until the end of the tour. To support the repatriation of Op HARMONY personnel, Operation WALLEYE was mounted and began moving soldiers home in mid September. Flying out of Split Croatia, the flights continued until 17 October 1995, when the last of the Op HARMONY personnel were repatriated."}}, {"opName": "CHAPERON", "countryRegion": "Croatia", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1996-02-01", "endDate": "2002-12-15", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/chaperon.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Europe", "Location": "Prevlaka Peninsula, Croatia", "Mission Date": "1 February 1996 - 15 December 2002", "Mission Mandate": " To monitor the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula and of the neighbouring areas in Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and hold regular meetings with the local authorities in order to strengthen liaison, reduce tensions, improve safety and security and promote confidence between the parties.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " The Prevlaka peninsula dominates the entrance to Kotor Bay (Boka Kotorska) where the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's military maintains its main naval base. It is a strategically important area about 45 kilometers south east of the Croatian coastal city of Dubrovnik. With the outbreak of war in 1991 and the capturing of territory south of Dubrovnik by FRY forces, dispute over ownership of the peninsula led to increased tensions between Croatia and the FRY. This resulted in the United Nations intervening and negotiating an agreement to demilitarize the region. In October 1992 the first military observers from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were deployed to the area to monitor the agreement. At the end of UNPROFOR's mandate in March of 1995, this responsibility was passed to the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation (UNCRO), which carried on the monitoring until the completion of its mandate in January of 1996. This led to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1038(1996), by which the United Nations established the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) to carry on the work started by the two previous missions. UNMOP's area of responsibility was a demilitarized zone (DMZ) stretching from the tip of the Prevlaka peninsula up to the tripartite border between Croatia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Divided into Blue and Yellow zones, the Blue zones were free of military, police and civilians while police, carrying small arms only, could occupy positions in the Yellow. Except when restrictions of movement were imposed by either party, observers conducted regular vehicle, foot and standing patrols throughout both areas. Though Canada's participation in UNMOP ended in September 2001, it was not until 10 December 2002 that the governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia signed an agreement establishing a provisional cross-border regime on the Prevlaka peninsula.

The aircraft would be flown to Europe using the North Atlantic ferry route that had been developed during the Second World War by the RAF's Ferry Command. Leaving from Goose Bay or Gander in Newfoundland, aircraft would fly to Greenland, Iceland and on to Scotland and England. The first aircraft to make the flight were F-86 Sabres, on their way to create No. 1 Canadian Air Division. Under the name Operation LEAP FROG, three squadrons of Sabres would fly the route, trailed by a 426 Squadron North Star carrying servicing personnel. A total of four distinct operations were flown: As the CF-100 proved itself as an all weather night fighter, the decision was made to replace four squadrons of Sabres with four squadrons of Canucks. This would provide NATO with a more capable interception capability, as there was no all-weather or night fighter capability in Europe. The Canucks were flown to Europe under Operation NIMBLE BAT, and again 426 Squadron provided a North Star aircraft to carry support personnel for each stop-over. The timings for each of the four Nimble Bat operations are: The Canadair Sabre was constantly modified to maintain its edge as one of the best fighters of the era. As new Marks emerged off Canadair's production lines, these aircraft were ferried to Europe to replace the now dated aircraft. At the same time, T-33s for use by the Air Division and as Mutual Aid gifts to NATO members were also ferried across the Atlantic, under the name Operation RANDOM. The first operation began on 11 February 1954, ferrying new Sabre Vs, while the last mission, Random 30 commenced on 24 June 1957, with 24 Sabre Vis and six T-33s. In just over three years of ferrying, No. 1 Overseas Ferry Unit, supported by 426 Squadron, safely delivered more than 800 aircraft overseas. No. 1 OFU also brought aircraft back to Canada. With the introduction of the Mk VI Sabre, the now surplus Mk Vs were either donated to other NATO members, or brought back to Canada. HMCS Magnificent left the UK with 50 Sabres on 7 Nov 56; while No. 1 OFU completed two ferrying operations from east to west across the North Atlantic - Operations RANDOM WEST I and II, on 17-19 Oct 56 (20 Sabre Vs) and 17-20 Nov 56 (16 Sabre Vs). (These operations were also referred to as REVERSE RANDOM.) When Belgium purchased 53 Avro CF-100 Canucks, the RCAF delivered them in Operation JUMP MOAT. There were five missions under this op name, with the numbers 3 and 4 also bringing CF-100s to the Air Division and number 5 being solely Air Division aircraft. The need to transfer aircraft to Europe did not end with Operation Random. In 1958, the need to ferry T-33s to NATO members under the Mutual Aid agreement produced operation STAR FLIGHT, with eight T-33s going to Greece and 17 T-33s going to Turkey. The aircraft, accompanied by two North Stars from No. 426 Sqn, departed on 9 May and returned to Canada on 22 May. 1959 was to prove a very busy year for ferrying aircraft to Europe. On 9 June, 12 T-33s piloted by members of No. 129 Acceptance and Ferry Flight and escorted by a 426 Squadron North Star departed Goose Bay for No. 4 Wing as part of Operation SILVER DOZEN. They arrived safely at Baden-Sollingen on 15 June. A repeat of this operation was required in August, hence Operation SECOND SILVER DOZEN. This time, No. 129 AFF and No. 426 Sqn delivered 11 T-33s to No. 4 Wing. In September, Operation WESTERN WEAR ferried 22 T-33s to the Air Division, France, Greece, Portugal and Turkey. Pilots from No. 129 AFF were again accompanied by the familiar North Star from No. 426 Sqn, the operation starting 22 September and being completed with the return to Canada on 9 October. (This op was also referred to in RCAF files as Op Western Way.) Throughout the 1950s, the RCAF, under the authorization of the Government of Canada, provided aircraft to NATO allies under the Mutual Aid Agreement. In 1959, 19 Beech C-18 Expeditors were provided to France and another 6 to Portugal, flying to these countries under Operation BEECHFLIGHT. This operation started on 20 May and ended 4 June when the six Portuguese aircraft landed in that country. Each aircraft had a pilot and navigator, while a North Star from 426 Squadron carried the 12-man support section. Operation Western Weft and Western Weal were conducted in 1962, delivering aircraft to France and Greece respectively. On this occasion 40 T-33s and 10 Expeditors were given to France, and 10 T-33s to Greece. This operation was conducted in five separate missions between 17 April and 3 August. The RCAF also ferried aircraft inside aircraft. As CF-104 Starfighters were coming off the Canadair production line in Montreal, most were transported to Europe to equip No. 1 Air Division. These operations involved putting the CF-104 inside one of the newly acquired C-130 Hercules and flying it over in that manner. These operations, known as RHO DELTA, lasted from 1962 to 1965, ending when the last of the 185 CF-104s had been delivered.

At the same time, T-33s for use by the Air Division and as Mutual Aid gifts to NATO members were also ferried across the Atlantic, under the name Operation RANDOM. The first operation began on 11 February 1954, ferrying new Sabre Vs, while the last mission, Random 30 commenced on 24 June 1957, with 24 Sabre Vis and six T-33s. In just over three years of ferrying, No. 1 Overseas Ferry Unit, supported by 426 Squadron, safely delivered more than 800 aircraft overseas.\u00a0\n\nNo. 1 OFU also brought aircraft back to Canada.

The need to transfer aircraft to Europe did not end with Operation Random. In 1958, the need to ferry T-33s to NATO members under the Mutual Aid agreement produced operation STAR FLIGHT, with eight T-33s going to Greece and 17 T-33s going to Turkey.

On 9 June, 12 T-33s piloted by members of No. 129 Acceptance and Ferry Flight and escorted by a 426 Squadron North Star departed Goose Bay for No. 4 Wing as part of Operation SILVER DOZEN. They arrived safely at Baden-Sollingen on 15 June. A repeat of this operation was required in August, hence Operation SECOND SILVER DOZEN. This time, No. 129 AFF and No. 426 Sqn delivered 11 T-33s to No. 4 Wing.\u00a0\n\nIn September, Operation WESTERN WEAR ferried 22 T-33s to the Air Division, France, Greece, Portugal and Turkey. Pilots from No. 129 AFF were again accompanied by the familiar North Star from No. 426 Sqn, the operation starting 22 September and being completed with the return to Canada on 9 October. (This op was also referred to in RCAF files as Op Western Way.)\u00a0\n\nThroughout the 1950s, the RCAF, under the authorization of the Government of Canada, provided aircraft to NATO allies under the Mutual Aid Agreement. In 1959, 19 Beech C-18 Expeditors were provided to France and another 6 to Portugal, flying to these countries under Operation BEECHFLIGHT. This operation started on 20 May and ended 4 June when the six Portuguese aircraft landed in that country. Each aircraft had a pilot and navigator, while a North Star from 426 Squadron carried the 12-man support section.\u00a0\n\nOperation Western Weft and Western Weal were conducted in 1962, delivering aircraft to France and Greece respectively. On this occasion 40 T-33s and 10 Expeditors were given to France, and 10 T-33s to Greece. This operation was conducted in five separate missions between 17 April and 3 August.\u00a0\n\nThe RCAF also ferried aircraft inside aircraft. As CF-104 Starfighters were coming off the Canadair production line in Montreal, most were transported to Europe to equip No. 1 Air Division. These operations involved putting the CF-104 inside one of the newly acquired C-130 Hercules and flying it over in that manner. These operations, known as RHO DELTA, lasted from 1962 to 1965, ending when the last of the 185 CF-104s had been delivered.

Initially, UNPROFOR was established in Croatia as an interim arrangement to create the conditions of peace and security required for the negotiation of an overall settlement of crisis following Slovenia\u2019s and Croatia\u2019s declarations of independence from the Yugoslav federation. Its mandate was to ensure that the three \"United Nations Protected Areas\" (UNPAs) in Croatia were demilitarized and that all persons residing in them were protected from fear of armed attack.\u00a0\n\nOver the course of 1992, UNPROFOR's mandate was enlarged to include monitoring functions in certain other areas of Croatia (\"pink zones\"); to enable the Force to control the entry of civilians into the UNPAs and to perform immigration and customs functions at the UNPA borders at international frontiers; and to include monitoring of the demilitarization of the Prevlaka Peninsula and to ensure control of the Peruca dam, situated in one of the \"pink zones\".\u00a0\n\nIn June 1992, as the conflict intensified and extended to Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNPROFOR's mandate and strength were enlarged in order to ensure the security and functioning of the airport at Sarajevo, and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to that city and its environs.\u00a0\n\nIn September 1992, UNPROFOR's mandate was further enlarged to enable it to support efforts by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to deliver humanitarian relief throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to protect convoys of released civilian detainees if the International Committee of the Red Cross so requested. The Force also monitored the \"no-fly\" zone, banning all military flights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the United Nations \"safe areas\" established by the Security Council around five Bosnian towns and the city of Sarajevo.\u00a0\n\nUNPROFOR was authorized to use force in self-defence in reply to attacks against these areas, and to coordinate with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) the use of air power in support of its activities. Similar arrangements were subsequently extended to the territory of Croatia.\n\nIn December 1992, UNPROFOR was deployed to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to monitor and report any developments in its border areas, which could undermine confidence and stability in that Republic and threaten its territory.\n\nIn March 1994, UNPROFOR began monitoring the implementation of a cease-fire agreement signed by the Croatian Government and local Serb authorities following the flare-up of fighting in January and again in September 1993.\n\nOn the 1st of January 1995, UNPROFOR began monitoring a cease-fire agreement that had been negotiated between the Bosnian Government and Bosnian Serb forces, and in February it began the implementation of a cease-fire agreement signed by the Bosnian Government and Bosnian Croat forces.\n\nOn 31 March 1995, the Security Council decided to restructure UNPROFOR, replacing it with three separate but interlinked peacekeeping operations.\n\nSupported by United Nations Security Council Resolutions 743, 749, 758, 761, 762, 764, 769, 776, 779, 781, 786, 795, 807, 815, 819, 824, 836, 838 842, 844, 847, 869, 870, 871, 900, 908, 914, 947, and 982", "Mission Notes": " Initial attempts to monitor the deteriorating situation in Yugoslavia in 1991 by the European Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM) were soon joined by the United Nations in December 1991.

A small group (UN Military Liaison Mission - UNMLOY), containing six Canadian and other military officers, civilian police and members of the United Nations Secretariat, travelled to Yugoslavia to prepare for the implementation of this plan.\n\nOn 21 February 1992, the United Nations Security Council authorized Resolution 743, to create the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Its mandate was to support the cease-fire while the Yugoslav crisis was being resolved by international diplomacy. As part of the new peacekeeping mission, Canadian Brigadier-General Lewis MacKenzie was appointed Chief of Staff in UNPROFOR Headquarters. Initially UNPROFOR peacekeepers were to be deployed into United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs), where the majority of Croatian Serbs lived and where most of the fighting had taken place.

In September 1991 the UN Security Council, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, passed resolution 713 imposing a weapons and military equipment embargo on Yugoslavia. Resolution 757, also under chapter VII, followed on 30 May 1992. This resolution included the imposition of a complete embargo on all goods and products originating in or destined for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), with the exception of medical supplies and foodstuffs. On 10 July 1992, the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Alliance agreed to a NATO contribution in support of the two Security Council resolutions under the name Operation MARITIME MONITOR. The NATO units deployed on this operation were ordered to conduct \u201csurveillance, identification and reporting of maritime traffic in areas to be defined in international waters in the Adriatic Sea\u201d.\u00a0\n\nOn 16 July 1992, the NATO Standing Naval Force Mediterranean (SNFM) started patrolling in international waters off the coast of Montenegro. In the air, American, British and Portuguese maritime patrol aircraft checked out all surface contacts, while NATO Airborne Early Warning Force (NAEWF) E3-A aircraft provided the integration of all surveillance pictures. Beginning on 16 October 1992, the NAEWF aircraft assumed the dual role of supporting Op Maritime Monitor, and helping to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 781 under the name Op SKY MONITOR, by monitoring the airspace over Bosnia - Herzegovina.\u00a0\n\nConcurrently, the Western European Union had deployed naval and air forces in support of resolutions 713 and 757.

HMCS Gatineau joined SNFL on 20 July in Portsmouth, England. At that time, the Commander of SNFL, Rear-Admiral Dyer (USN) advised the ship\u2019s company of the possibility of participating in Op Maritime Monitor. On 27 August, SNFL was advised that they would be deploying to Op Maritime Monitor, to temporarily replace SNFM. SNFL assumed the embargo duties from SNFM on 9 September, handing over to SNFM again on 26 September. During this time, HMCS Gatineau conducted two operational patrols (10-17 and 20-25 September).

Such allegations would continue throughout the entire Yugoslav civil war. Acting on these allegations, on October 6, 1992 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 780(1992), requesting the Secretary General to establish an impartial Commission of Experts (UNCOE) to provide its conclusions on the evidence of grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. On 23 October, the Secretary-General informed the Council that he had appointed a five-person commission. It commenced work early in November 1992 and carried out four main tasks: the examination and analysis of information obtained from various sources, identification of cases warranting in-depth investigation, verification of facts and considerations of issues of law. Throughout the period of UNCOE's investigations, from October 1992 until April 1994, the Canadian Forces provided personnel under the designation Operation JUSTICE. CF legal officers and military police personnel, up to seven at a time, worked with UNCOE. On several occasions they formed a War Crimes Investigation Team for specific investigations such as, for example, an enquiry into a mass grave at Ovcara near Vukovar in March 1993. For the year and a half that the commission operated, it collected thousands of pages of documentation as well as video information on allegations of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, and created a database providing a comprehensive, record of all reported crimes. UNCOE's work came to an end on 30 April 1994 and, one month later, their Final Report was submitted to the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.

UNPRFOR was requested to enforce this ban, while individual states or regional organizations were called upon to assist UNPROFOR. NATO ships and the NATO Airborne Early Warning Force (NAEWF) E-3A aircraft had been involved in enforcing a United Nations mandated naval monitoring operation in the Adriatic since 16 July 1992 (Operation MARITIME MONITOR). The E-3As were patrolling over the Adriatic Sea. NATO agreed to expand the mandate of these aircraft to include the enforcement of the flight ban under Resolution 781. Commencing 16 October, this new operation became NATO's Operation Sky Monitor. The original patrols continued over the Adriatic, and on 31 October expanded to include another patrol area over Hungary, when the Hungarian government granted permission for an air orbit to allow coverage of former Yugoslavian airspace not covered by the Adriatic orbit. Flying from Geilenkirchen, Germany, the E-3As used forward operating bases at Trapani, Italy and Preveza, Greece and the air base at Aviano, Italy. The aircrews were multinational drawn from 11 NATO members (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey and United States). Also participating in Op Sky Monitor were British E-3Ds from No. 8 Squadron, RAF Waddington and French E-3F from Avord Air Base. In the period from 16 October 1992, NATO AEW aircraft documented over 500 airspace violations. As a result the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 816 on 31 March 1993.

Following up these Chapter VII actions, the Security Council passed Resolution 787 on 16 November 1992, which further tightened the embargo. On 20 November, the North Atlantic Council (NAC) approved the commitment of NATO forces in support of the resolution, and in coordination with Western European Union (WEU) forces in the Adriatic.

The mandate of ODF was to demonstrate NATO resolve in support of UN resolutions regarding Kosovo, to enforce the \u201cno-fly\u201d zone over Bosnia and to prepare for limited air strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " As the former Yugoslavia continued its break-up through 1998, tensions between ethnic Albanians and the security forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Yugoslavia) escalated in Kosovo. As Yugoslav forces violently broke-up peaceful demonstrations and increasingly intimidated civilians, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) attacked Yugoslav forces in a guerrilla campaign. The UN Security Council approved resolution 1160 demanding that all parties cease hostilities and that peaceful political processes be followed to resolve issues. Failing to heed the resolution, Yugoslav forces and the KLA stepped up the level of their aggression. The Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September, demanding that all parties cease hostilities and more importantly that further actions would be considered if stability were not restored. Accordingly, the North Atlantic Council activated Operation DETERMINED FORCE on 13 October.\u00a0\n\nOperation DETERMINED FORCE was a phased operation in which NATO would first attempt to demonstrate its resolve to enforce the Security Council\u2019s resolutions and prevent further violence. It allowed for limited air strikes, such as those against military targets, and a phased air campaign if Yugoslavia failed to meet the terms of the Security Council resolutions.\u00a0\n\nNATO nations quickly responded to the activation order. Aircraft from twelve nations soon arrived in the area around the Balkans, with fourteen nations supporting the operation. By 27 October, over 300 aircraft had deployed to airbases in France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom, as well as aircraft carriers in the Adriatic. These aircraft were soon flying missions over Bosnia in support of the \u201cno-fly\u201d zone, conducting combined training exercises, and participating in Partnership for Peace exercises in the region. They also served as a protection force for other NATO and UN missions operating in the former Yugoslavia.\u00a0\n\nOn 15 October 1998, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire and to withdraw those forces that had been mobilized and sent to Kosovo. He also accepted international verification of his compliance. NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) signed agreements with Yugoslavia creating Operation Eagle Eye and the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission respectively. NATO also planned an extraction force for a contingency extraction of personnel from Kosovo - Operation DETERMINED GUARANTOR.\u00a0\n\nThrough late 1998 and into early 1999, the violence of the KLA and Yugloslav forces escalated despite the ceasefire. NATO began negotiations involving both parties in Rambouillet, France on 6 February 1999. While the KLA ultimately accepted NATO\u2019s terms, on 19 March Yugoslavia rejected the Rambouillet Accords. By this time hundreds of civilians had been killed and over 300,000 forced out of their homes. With the rejection of the Accords, the escalation of violence - especially by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo \u2013 and the failure of Yugoslavia to heed warnings from NATO, NATO\u2019s Secretary-General authorized Operation Allied Force on 23 March, with operations beginning on 24 March. This ended Operation DETERMINED FORCE.\u00a0 Operation ECHO - 13 October 1998 to 23 March 1999 No Canadian Operation Name - 13 October 1998 to 23 March 1999 Canada had already been involved in enforcing the \u201cno-fly\u201d zone over Bosnia through personnel deployed to the NATO Airborne Early Warning squadron, operating under the NATO name Operation DELIBERATE FORGE. When this operation ended and Operation DETERMINED FORCE began, the NATO AWACS personnel made the transition. The aircraft would fly over other nations bordering the former Yugoslavia to monitor the situation in the airspace over that country. This operation did not have a Canadian operation name.\u00a0 In a show of NATO resolve, Canada announced on 20 June 1998 that six CF-188 Hornets would deploy to Aviano, Italy to enhance Alliance capabilities and improve Canada\u2019s response time to any crisis in the area. The Hornets would be available for NATO demonstration exercises, as well as enforcing the \u201cno-fly\u201d zone. They deployed under NATO Operation DELIBERATE FORGE, the Canadian name of which was Operation ECHO. When Operation DETERMINED FORCE began, these aircraft and personnel made the transition to the new operation, which was also given the Canadian name Operation ECHO.\u00a0 The six CF-188s averaged about 80 missions a month, mostly over Bosnia. Each sortie lasted about 2 \u00bd hours and was an international effort, involving airborne refueling aircraft, airborne early warning aircraft and controllers from several nations. The Canadian effort was also a broad one. Task Force Aviano (TFA) personnel rotated on a six-month schedule, with pilots rotating every three months. Most personnel were either from 3 Wing Bagotville or 4 Wing Cold Lake; however, personnel from across the Air Force augmented these two Wings. The occupations of TFA also represented most Air Force occupations.\u00a0 Support for Op Echo came from the Hercules and Airbuses of 435, 436 and 437 Squadrons. Weekly resupply flights in support of Op ECHO, and Op PALLADIUM (NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia) brought personnel, equipment, parts and supplies to TFA.\u00a0 With the degeneration of the situation in Kosovo, followed by the failure of negotiations, Op DETERMINED FORCE ended on 23 March 1999 when NATO authorized Operation ALLIED FORCE. Canada entered Op ALLIED FORCE with six CF-188s and about 130 people. Overall, about 275 CF personnel took part in Op DETERMINED FORCE."}}, {"opName": "WESTERN WEFT", "countryRegion": "France", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1962-04-17", "endDate": "1962-08-03", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/western-weft.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation WESTERN WEFT", "International Mission Name": "Operation WESTERN WEFT", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Europe", "Location": "France", "Mission Date": "17 April 1962 - 3 August 1962", "Mission Mandate": " To ferry RCAF aircraft to France.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " With the stand\u2013up of NATO and the emergence of the Cold War, Europe was seen as the next potential battleground, so much so that even the Korean War was seen as a diversion. Canada committed herself to providing 12 squadrons of aircraft as well as ground forces in an effort to deter attacks and defend Western Europe. The aircraft would be flown to Europe using the North Atlantic ferry route that had been developed during the Second World War by the RAF\u2019s Ferry Command. Leaving from Goose Bay or Gander in Newfoundland, aircraft would fly to Greenland, Iceland and on to Scotland and England. The first aircraft to make the flight were F\u201386 Sabres, on their way to create No. 1 Canadian Air Division. Under the name Operation LEAP FROG, three squadrons of Sabres would fly the route, trailed by a 426 Squadron North Star carrying servicing personnel. A total of four distinct operations were flown: As the CF\u2013100 proved itself as an all weather night fighter, the decision was made to replace four squadrons of Sabres with four squadrons of Canucks. This would provide NATO with a more capable interception capability, as there was no all\u2013weather or night fighter capability in Europe. The Canucks were flown to Europe under Operation NIMBLE BAT, and again 426 Squadron provided a North Star aircraft to carry support personnel for each stop\u2013over. The timings for each of the four Nimble Bat operations are: The Canadair Sabre was constantly modified to maintain its edge as one of the best fighters of the era. As new Marks emerged off Canadair\u2019s production lines, these aircraft were ferried to Europe to replace the now dated aircraft. At the same time, T\u201333s for use by the Air Division and as Mutual Aid gifts to NATO members were also ferried across the Atlantic, under the name Operation RANDOM. The first operation began on 11 February 1954, ferrying new Sabre Vs, while the last mission, Random 30 commenced on 24 June 1957, with 24 Sabre Vis and six T\u201333s. In just over three years of ferrying, No. 1 Overseas Ferry Unit, supported by 426 Squadron, safely delivered more than 800 aircraft overseas. No. 1 OFU also brought aircraft back to Canada. With the introduction of the Mk VI Sabre, the now surplus Mk Vs were either donated to other NATO members, or brought back to Canada. HMCS Magnificent left the UK with 50 Sabres on 7 Nov 56; while No. 1 OFU completed two ferrying operations from east to west across the North Atlantic \u2013 Operations RANDOM WEST I and II, on 17\u201319 Oct 56 (20 Sabre Vs) and 17\u201320 Nov 56 (16 Sabre Vs). (These operations were also referred to as REVERSE RANDOM.) When Belgium purchased 53 Avro CF\u2013100 Canucks, the RCAF delivered them in Operation JUMP MOAT. There were five missions under this op name, with the numbers 3 and 4 also bringing CF\u2013100s to the Air Division and number 5 being solely Air Division aircraft. The need to transfer aircraft to Europe did not end with Operation Random. In 1958, the need to ferry T\u201333s to NATO members under the Mutual Aid agreement produced operation STAR FLIGHT, with eight T\u201333s going to Greece and 17 T\u201333s going to Turkey. The aircraft, accompanied by two North Stars from No. 426 Sqn, departed on 9 May and returned to Canada on 22 May. 1959 was to prove a very busy year for ferrying aircraft to Europe. On 9 June, 12 T\u201333s piloted by members of No. 129 Acceptance and Ferry Flight and escorted by a 426 Squadron North Star departed Goose Bay for No. 4 Wing as part of Operation SILVER DOZEN. They arrived safely at Baden\u2013Sollingen on 15 June. A repeat of this operation was required in August, hence Operation SECOND SILVER DOZEN. This time, No. 129 AFF and No. 426 Sqn delivered 11 T\u201333s to No. 4 Wing. In September, Operation WESTERN WEAR ferried 22 T\u201333s to the Air Division, France, Greece, Portugal and Turkey. Pilots from No. 129 AFF were again accompanied by the familiar North Star from No. 426 Sqn, the operation starting 22 September and being completed with the return to Canada on 9 October. (This op was also referred to in RCAF files as Op Western Way.) Throughout the 1950s, the RCAF, under the authorization of the Government of Canada, provided aircraft to NATO allies under the Mutual Aid Agreement. In 1959, 19 Beech C\u201318 Expeditors were provided to France and another 6 to Portugal, flying to these countries under Operation BEECHFLIGHT. This operation started on 20 May and ended 4 June when the six Portuguese aircraft landed in that country. Each aircraft had a pilot and navigator, while a North Star from 426 Squadron carried the 12\u2013man support section. Operation Western Weft and Western Weal were conducted in 1962, delivering aircraft to France and Greece respectively. On this occasion 40 T\u201333s and 10 Expeditors were given to France, and 10 T\u201333s to Greece. This operation was conducted in five separate missions between 17 April and 3 August. The RCAF also ferried aircraft inside aircraft. As CF\u2013104 Starfighters were coming off the Canadair production line in Montreal, most were transported to Europe to equip No. 1 Air Division. These operations involved putting the CF\u2013104 inside one of the newly acquired C\u2013130 Hercules and flying it over in that manner. These operations, known as RHO DELTA, lasted from 1962 to 1965, ending when the last of the 185 CF\u2013104s had been delivered.

At the same time, T\u201333s for use by the Air Division and as Mutual Aid gifts to NATO members were also ferried across the Atlantic, under the name Operation RANDOM. The first operation began on 11 February 1954, ferrying new Sabre Vs, while the last mission, Random 30 commenced on 24 June 1957, with 24 Sabre Vis and six T\u201333s. In just over three years of ferrying, No. 1 Overseas Ferry Unit, supported by 426 Squadron, safely delivered more than 800 aircraft overseas. No. 1 OFU also brought aircraft back to Canada. With the introduction of the Mk VI Sabre, the now surplus Mk Vs were either donated to other NATO members, or brought back to Canada. HMCS Magnificent left the UK with 50 Sabres on 7 Nov 56; while No. 1 OFU completed two ferrying operations from east to west across the North Atlantic \u2013 Operations RANDOM WEST I and II, on 17\u201319 Oct 56 (20 Sabre Vs) and 17\u201320 Nov 56 (16 Sabre Vs). (These operations were also referred to as REVERSE RANDOM.) When Belgium purchased 53 Avro CF\u2013100 Canucks, the RCAF delivered them in Operation JUMP MOAT. There were five missions under this op name, with the numbers 3 and 4 also bringing CF\u2013100s to the Air Division and number 5 being solely Air Division aircraft. The need to transfer aircraft to Europe did not end with Operation Random. In 1958, the need to ferry T\u201333s to NATO members under the Mutual Aid agreement produced operation STAR FLIGHT, with eight T\u201333s going to Greece and 17 T\u201333s going to Turkey. The aircraft, accompanied by two North Stars from No. 426 Sqn, departed on 9 May and returned to Canada on 22 May. 1959 was to prove a very busy year for ferrying aircraft to Europe. On 9 June, 12 T\u201333s piloted by members of No. 129 Acceptance and Ferry Flight and escorted by a 426 Squadron North Star departed Goose Bay for No. 4 Wing as part of Operation SILVER DOZEN. They arrived safely at Baden\u2013Sollingen on 15 June. A repeat of this operation was required in August, hence Operation SECOND SILVER DOZEN. This time, No. 129 AFF and No. 426 Sqn delivered 11 T\u201333s to No. 4 Wing. In September, Operation WESTERN WEAR ferried 22 T\u201333s to the Air Division, France, Greece, Portugal and Turkey. Pilots from No. 129 AFF were again accompanied by the familiar North Star from No. 426 Sqn, the operation starting 22 September and being completed with the return to Canada on 9 October. (This op was also referred to in RCAF files as Op Western Way.) Throughout the 1950s, the RCAF, under the authorization of the Government of Canada, provided aircraft to NATO allies under the Mutual Aid Agreement. In 1959, 19 Beech C\u201318 Expeditors were provided to France and another 6 to Portugal, flying to these countries under Operation BEECHFLIGHT. This operation started on 20 May and ended 4 June when the six Portuguese aircraft landed in that country. Each aircraft had a pilot and navigator, while a North Star from 426 Squadron carried the 12\u2013man support section. Operation Western Weft and Western Weal were conducted in 1962, delivering aircraft to France and Greece respectively. On this occasion 40 T\u201333s and 10 Expeditors were given to France, and 10 T\u201333s to Greece. This operation was conducted in five separate missions between 17 April and 3 August. The RCAF also ferried aircraft inside aircraft. As CF\u2013104 Starfighters were coming off the Canadair production line in Montreal, most were transported to Europe to equip No. 1 Air Division. These operations involved putting the CF\u2013104 inside one of the newly acquired C\u2013130 Hercules and flying it over in that manner. These operations, known as RHO DELTA, lasted from 1962 to 1965, ending when the last of the 185 CF\u2013104s had been delivered. (Rho Delta is ancient Greek for 100 \u2013Rho\u2013 and 4 \u2013 Delta)."}}, {"opName": "GLAUCUS", "countryRegion": "Greece", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "2004-08-01", "endDate": "2004-09-30", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/glaucus.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation GLAUCUS", "International Mission Name": "Operation GLAUCUS", "Mandating Organization": "North Atlantic Council", "Region Name": "Europe", "Location": "Greece", "Mission Date": "1 August 2004 - 30 September 2004", "Mission Mandate": " To assist in the NATO provision of security support to the Government of Greece during the Olympic and Paralympic Games.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " On 24 June 2004, the North Atlantic Council agreed to the Government of Greece\u2019s request for security assistance during the Olympic Games (13-29 August) and the Paralympic Games (17 to 28 September).

At the same time, the Hungarian communist party was divided between reformers and Stalinists. On 23 October, students began marching in the streets of Budapest in support of the revolution in Poland and demanding that the Soviet Union withdraw its occupation troops. Hungarian soldiers, instead of putting down the march, began to remove the Red Star on their hats and uniforms in sympathy. The number of marchers soon reached about 100,000. At this point the protest was peaceful, but the Hungarian Security Police (AVO) opened fire on the crowds. A riot started, while supportive arms factory workers began to hand out weapons to the protesters. The government called in the Soviet troops that were installed around the country; and they intervened starting on 24 October. Hungarian youth fought the Soviet tanks with Molotov cocktails and rifles. The Hungarian military was also called in, but they soon ceased attacking the protesters and reached informal cease-fires with them. The Soviet troops also reached informal cease-fires with the protesters in some areas, but in other locales put down the protesters violently. The fighting continued until 28 October. Throughout Hungary, the people began electing Municipal Councils, while workers elected Workers Councils. Political prisoners were released, while Premier Imre Nagy declared Hungary a neutral state. It was at this point that the Soviet leadership decided to crush the revolution with extreme force. On the morning of 4 November, newly-arrived Soviet armoured regiments supported by the AVO entered Budapest and other major cities where they did not shy away from opening fire. The Hungarian people fought back, but it was an unequal contest and order was restored in most of the country by 10 November. By then thousands of Hungarians had fled the country, making their way to Austria. As soon as the fighting started on 24 October, medical supplies began to arrive in Hungary from communist bloc neighbours. Hungarian expatriates around the world also began to collect humanitarian aid. The Hungarian-Canadian community reacted quickly, gathered supplies in Toronto which were picked up by a 426 Squadron North Star on 30 October. The North Star arrived in Vienna on November 1st, expecting to be met by the Canadian Ambassador and Austrian Red Cross officials. Dressed in their best uniforms, they were shepherded by the police to an office, after which a heated exchange occurred between various officials. Finally, an elderly gentleman asked the crew if they had any civilian clothes, to which they replied affirmatively. They were immediately ordered to put them on. Returning to the lounge in civilian clothes, they were met with a warm welcome. Unknowingly, the crew had broken a 1955 Peace Protocol between the western allies and the Soviet Union that prohibited foreign military forces in Austria. Canada would eventually welcome 8,000 of the more than 200,000 Hungarians who left the country before the Soviet army sealed the borders."}}, {"opName": "Iceland 1973", "countryRegion": "Iceland", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1973-06-11", "endDate": "1973-08-30", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/iceland-1973.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Iceland 1973", "International Mission Name": "Iceland 1973", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Europe", "Location": "Vestmannaeyar, island of Heimaey, Iceland", "Mission Date": "11 June 1973 - 30 August 1973", "Mission Mandate": "To deliver pre-fabricated homes to Iceland.", "Mission/Operation Notes": "Iceland sits astride the mid-Atlantic rift, where the tectonic plates under the Atlantic Ocean are slowly separating.

Civil disobedience produced a reaction by the Protestant community and, in due course, that led to civil unrest, the development of para-military groups on both sides, and sectarian violence which culminated in the deployment of the British Army to Ulster. Ultimately, three primary interest groups became involved: the pro-united Ireland groups led by the Irish Republican Army (IRA); the Loyalist groups led by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF); and the government of the United Kingdom represented by the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Between 1972 and 1993 there were at least seven well-publicised and formal political initiatives to bring an end to the violence. All ended in failure, and it seemed that the conflicting views and demands of the various parties could never be reconciled. However, the British government and the IRA were also holding direct (and secret) talks through most of this period, and in 1994 the IRA declared a unilateral ceasefire, which was followed by ceasefire declarations by the UDA and UVF in October. Although the interested parties, including the Government of Ireland, would not and could not sit down at all-party talks for various reasons, Britain and Ireland jointly established an international body in November 1995.\u00a0\n\nOn 26 August 1997, the British and Irish governments signed the \u201cAgreement on Independent International Commission on Decommissioning\u201d (IICD). The international body consisted of US Senator George Mitchell, former Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri and retired Canadian General John de Chastelain. Their task was to determine how (and at what point) to bring about the decommissioning (surrender and eventual destruction) of all the weapons held by all the paramilitary groups in Ireland \u2013 something that would have to happen for there to be peace in the North. Their report recommended that decommissoning take place during the negotiation process, rather than before (as a precondition, because lack of agreement could prolong discussions forever) or after (when the risk of renewed violence might nullify any settlement) \u2013 and that it be supervised by an \u201cIndependent Commission.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAlthough the work of the IICD is behind schedule, the Commission's report of 26 September 2005 indicated that the Commission believed the IRA had put their munitions beyond use.

However, in January 1997, the Norwegian government announced it could no longer support this operation. Canada was informally requested to take over as \u201clead nation\u201d for MAMDRIM in January 1997, and officially accepted as of 19 March, though without providing the CC-130 Hercules and crew which had been part of SFOR\u2019s original request. Operation BISON, as the Canadian commitment would be called, would comprise an operations and support staff of three officers and eight NCOs based at Rimini, and one Liaison Officer at the Regional Air Movement Control Centre in Vincenza, Italy. On 3 April 1997, the Canadian Contingent in MAMDRIM (CCIM, Op BISON) would be declared operationally ready. It should be noted that the contingent name was changed to Canadian Air Component MAMDRIM (CACIM) between August and November 1997, and later changed back to CCIM until its closure in June 1998. CACIM was in charge of all TALCC operations from the Rimini base, primarily in support of a Greek (HAF, Hellenic Air Force) C-130 tasked to SFOR, as well as a Royal Norwegian Air Force C-130 (later replaced by a Belgian Air Force C-130) flying relief supplies between Sarajevo and Albania from 12 to 21 June 1998. In total, Op BISON would oversee 1,165 NATO flights, move 88,763 SFOR personnel, and transport 9.5 million pounds of freight. By the end of Op BISON\u2019s mandate on 20 June 1998, a total of 60 Canadian Regular and Reserve Force personnel (mostly from 8 Wing, CFB Trenton) had served in both Rimini and Vincenza. All MAMDRIM responsibilities would be handed over to a Greek Contingent on 17 June 1998, with the final Canadians leaving Rimini on 28 June."}}, {"opName": "SARNO", "countryRegion": "Italy", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1998-05-13", "endDate": "1998-06-21", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/sarno.html", "details": {"Mudslide Relief Mission Southern Italy": "NONE", "Name": "Op SARNO -Date:13 May 1998 - 21 June 1998", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Mandate": "To provide clean-up assistance in the town of Sarno, Italy", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " On May 5th and 6th, 1998, the Sarno area 30 kilometres east of Naples was hit by torrential rainfall.

Each of the five missions operated independently in an effort to stay apprised of the situation within the province.\u00a0\n\nIn September 1998, the UN issued UNSCR 1199 under chapter VII of the UN charter expressing concern about the situation in Kosovo. It also sent US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke to negotiate a monitoring and cease-fire agreement with FRY President Slobodan. According to the agreement the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) would establish a Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) to monitor the situation on the ground. And under the direction of NATO, an operation would be established to monitor the situation from the air (Op EAGLE EYE). On 24 October 1998, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1203 supporting the establishment of both operations and late October KVM began operations.\u00a0\n\nTo help coordinate the efforts of the OSCE and NATO, the Kosovo Verification Coordination Centre (KVCC) was established in Kumanovo, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Manned 24 hours a day, the 60-man team from various NATO nations performed the duties of liaison, planning coordination and information exchange between the two missions. By tracking both operations, the centre was able to coordinate efforts between missions and provide NATO headquarters in Brussels with a clear picture of the situation in Kosovo.

Canada supplied one senior liaison officer (LO), one billeting NCO, and six military police officers for security.\u00a0\n\nThough the number of KVM verification personnel was initially set at 2000, the number never rose above 1350. OSCE KVM established five Regional Centers (RCs) in Pec, Prizren, Kosovska Mitrovica, Gnjilane, and Pristina. Their mandate was to verify compliance by all parties in Kosovo with UN Security Council Resolution 1199, verify the cease-fire, monitor movements of forces, look for and report unsanctioned road blocks, monitor border control activities, and promote human rights and democracy-building.\u00a0\n\nCanada\u2019s contribution to OSCE KVM consisted of up to 60 civilian and police personnel, and a military component under the designation Operation KIMONO, consisting of 23 CF personnel. The main body of the military component deployed to Kosovo in November and December of 1998, with the two CF personnel assigned to the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM) being reassigned to the KVM operation in December 1998 thus closing out that mission.\u00a0\n\nWhile the FRY retained overall responsibility for the security of the OSCE personnel deployed in Kosovo, NATO took the extra precaution of establishing a 1500 man strong Extraction Force operating in the Former Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) under the Operation name JOINT GUARANTOR incase the situation deteriorated. Canada committed approximately 62 support personnel to this force under the designation Op GUARANTOR. The operation included airfield construction engineers, medical and headquarters personnel who were deployed to Kumanovo, in the FYROM in mid-December.\u00a0\n\nDespite the KVM presence, the situation in Kosovo flared up again at the beginning of 1999. On the morning of 20 March 1999, the OSCE placed all members of KVM and Op KIMINO on three hours notice to move, and began to evacuate them to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). When negotiations failed, NATO began air strikes against the FRY and all members of Op KIMONO were repatriated to Canada.

On 15 October, following nine days of intense negotiations, both parties agreed to a cease-fire and a two-pronged approach to monitoring the situation. In accordance with the agreement, NATO was to conduct unarmed flights over the region (NATO Op EAGLE EYE)(Op KAYAK), and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would establish a Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM)(Op KIMONO) to observe compliance on the ground. The UN Security Council endorsed the establishment of these two missions when on 24 October 1998 it passed resolution 1203.

As Yugoslav forces violently broke-up peaceful demonstrations and increasingly intimidated civilians, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) attacked Yugoslav forces in a guerrilla campaign. The UN Security Council approved Resolution 1160 demanding that all parties cease hostilities and that peaceful political processes be followed to resolve issues. Ignoring the resolution, Yugoslav forces and the KLA stepped up the level of their aggressions with the result that by the summer of 1998 hundreds of civilians had been killed and over 300,000 forced out of their homes. In response, the Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September, demanding that all parties cease hostilities and more importantly that further actions would be considered if stability were not restored. Accordingly, the North Atlantic Council activated Operation Determined Force (ODF) on 13 October in an effort to show NATO\u2019s resolve. ODF did allow for the use of limited air strikes, such as against military targets, and also for a potential escalation of the use of force.\u00a0\n\nNATO nations quickly responded to the activation order.

On 15 October 1998, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire and to withdraw those forces that had been mobilized and sent to Kosovo. He also accepted international verification of his compliance. NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) signed agreements with Yugoslavia creating Operation Eagle Eye and the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission respectively.

US special envoy Richard Holbrooke negotiated with FRY President Slobodan Milosevic in early October 1998 in an attempt to have the FRY comply with the UN resolution. Finally, following nine days of intense negotiations, an agreement was reached that allowed for the establishment of two monitoring operations. It was agreed that the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM)(Op KIMONO) would monitor the situation on the ground, and that the NATO led Operation EAGLE EYE (Op KAYAK) would conduct unarmed monitoring operations from the air. Despite written agreement, FRY continued to be built up its forces in Kosovo during the latter part of 1998, and open conflict continued in the face of KVM monitors. This open disregard for the agreement lead a group of nations called the Contact Group to bring the parties involved in the dispute to Rambouillet, France in February 1999 in an effort to find a diplomatic solution to the situation. Negotiations at Rambouillet, and later in Paris, led to a basic agreement with the Kosovars but one that the government of the FRY refused to accept. In March of 1999, the failure of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and FRY forces to comply with the basic tenants of UN Security Council Resolution 1199, forced the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to pull all Kosovo Verification Monitors (KVM) out of Kosovo. In the face of continued warnings that NATO military action was imminent, a final diplomatic effort was made to reach agreement. When these efforts failed, NATO pursued military action and on 24 March 1999 NATO launched Operation ALLIED FORCE and began air operations against FRY. The purpose of the air operations was to restore peace and security to the area and thereby resolve the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. Milosevic\u2019s forces responded with an all-out campaign to ethnically cleanse Kosovo of its Albanian population driving hundreds of thousands of Albanians across the border into Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro. When the bombing campaign began, the Canadian military element consisted of six CF-18s stationed at Aviano, Italy - code-named Task Force Aviano, Operation ECHO.

NATO commanders and the Yugoslav government signed The Military Technical Agreement that brought a suspension of the bombing on 10 June. Ten days later, on 20 June, the NATO Secretary General formally ended the air campaign. Though KFOR continues to operate at a much-reduced size, at its height it comprised more than 50,000 personnel from 45 NATO and non-NATO countries. To date KFOR has helped more than 1.3 million Kosovo Albanians return to their homes and villages; cleared more than 16,000 houses, 1,165 schools and almost 2,000 kilometres of roads of mines and unexploded ordnance; and continues to support some 4,500 international Police as part of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).", "Name": "KINETIC", "Date": "24 March 1999 - 21 June 2000", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " The end of the air campaign required peacekeepers on the ground to enforce the cease-fire.

Approximately 800 Canadian troops arrived in Macedonia in May of 1999, joining the 4th (UK) Armoured Brigade under the Canadian designation Operation KINETIC (NATO designation Operation JOINT GUARDIAN). In addition to national command and support element personnel, a reconnaissance squadron equipped with the new Coyote reconnaissance vehicle from Lord Strathcona\u2019s Horse (Royal Canadians), a helicopter detachment equipped with eight Griffon helicopters, and engineers formed the initial Canadian contribution. On 12 June 1999, the first elements of KFOR entered Kosovo.

By 20 June the Serb withdrawal was complete and KFOR was well established in Kosovo. The Canadian reconnaissance squadron arrived in the vanguard of the British armoured brigade, while other Canadians soon followed or were fully tasked in support roles in Macedonia.

Soldiers from the 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia\u2019s Canadian Light Infantry, and tanks from the Strathconas were formed into an infantry battle group with armoured support. The battalion began its deployment in early July and soon replaced overburdened British infantry units. The new arrivals raised the total strength of Operation KINETIC to approximately 1,400 personnel.

The conflict escalated to the point where, in February 1999, under international guidance, negotiators from the Kosovo Albanian population and the FRY government were brought together in Rambouillet, France to negotiate a truce. The former eventually agreed to terms; the latter did not, and continued instead to pour troops into the province. When continued negotiations failed, the United Nations removed all personnel associated with the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) which had been established earlier that year, and warned that NATO military action was imminent if the FRY did not comply with the Rambouillet agreement. In March a final diplomatic effort was made that ultimately met with failure. On 24 March 1999 NATO launched Operation ALLIED FORCE and began air operations against FRY. FRY forces responded with an all-out campaign to ethnically cleanse Kosovo of its Albanian population driving hundreds of thousands of Albanians across the border into Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro. With nearly 1 million Kosovar refugees now in neighboring countries, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) sent out an international appeal for help to deal with the situation. Canada stepped forward and agreed to resettle some of the refugees who had been displaced, and asked that the CF play a role. It was in response to this request that the Canadian Forces launched Operation PARASOL. On April 6 the CF issued a Warning Order placing CFBs Borden, Trenton, Kingston, Petawawa, and Meaford, on 72 hours notice to receive and house an expected 5000 refugees for up to six months. CFB Valcartier was designated as backup. Three days later, on 9 April, the CF was ready to receive the first refugees, and CFBs Greenwood, Aldershot, Gagetown, and Halifax, had been added to the operation. From the outset, Citizenship and Immigration Canada took the lead in the operation. The Canadian Forces was heavily involved in a support role providing transportation, accommodations, meals, medical services, and with the help of volunteers, much needed support and comfort. On May 2nd 1999, the first of what were to be daily flights of chartered A310 Airbuses began arriving in Canada with refugees aboard. Alternating between CFB Trenton, Ontario, and CFB Greenwood, Nova Scotia, the flights were met by volunteers from the Red Cross, local Lions and Rotary Clubs, The Salvation Army, members of the local community, and CF personnel to help the refugees move through the initial assessment process. Escort teams, consisting of one military person and one volunteer were assigned a group of between 7 and 14 refugees. Wherever possible, the groups consisted of whole families (including pets) to ensure they were not broken up or lost in transition. The teams were responsible for knowing the whereabouts of each group member at all times, and for their movement from station to station. This included immigration processing, medical screening, identification, showering, new clothing and a hot meal. A key step in the process was nicknamed \u201cthe shoe store,\u201d a station set up to replace shoes deemed \u201cagriculturally unsound\u201d - covered with too much dirt to clean - by Agriculture Canada. The entire primary reception process, including shoe fitting, was completed in less than an hour. Once the primary reception was complete, the refugees were either transported to accommodations on the base where they landed, or were moved to one of the other support bases. After spending approximately two months in these facilities the refugees were then moved to cities across Canada where they were offered the option of establishing themselves either temporarily or permanently in a community with the help of a sponsor. In either case, the refugees had the option to relocate back to Kosovo within 24 months of their original arrival to Canada. When stability was restored to Kosovo approximately one third of the Kosovars chose to repatriate the remainder made the decision to start a new life and stay in Canada. By the end of August 1999 when Operation PARASOL was brought to a close, the CF had processed more than 5500 refugees."}}, {"opName": "BOREAL IV", "countryRegion": "Lithuania and Ukraine", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1994-07-15", "endDate": "1994-08-05", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/boreal-iv.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Lithuania-Ukraine \u2013 1994", "International Mission Name": "Lithuania-Ukraine \u2013 1994", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Europe", "Location": "Former Soviet Union; Lithuania, Ukraine", "Mission Date": "15 July 1994 - 5 August 1994", "Mandate": "To deliver medical supplies to Lithuania and Ukraine.", "Narrative": "In 1992 and 1993, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) conducted three operations into the former Soviet Union, flying in primarily medical supplies.

Concurrently, on 20 September, members of the infantry platoon serving with the Task Force were assigned to Operation HEMP, a one day British operation involving weapons collection close to the Albanian border. Other Canadian troops deployed on Operation FORAGE helped set up the Canadian camp, provided communications, medical and logistical support to both the Canadian contingent and other NATO personnel, and assisted with the weapons collection process. At the end of September 2001, Operation FORAGE was brought to a close with the return of the last staff officer form Skopje.

As the air flowed from the high to the low pressure area the steep pressure gradient generated winds that gusted to 200 km/h (120 mph) off the coast of Scotland. The low then shifted southwards pushing a strong storm surge ahead of it and generating high waves. The east coast of England and Scotland were overwhelmed by the force of the North Sea. A car ferry sank off Scotland, claiming 133 lives. Over 170 other people lost their lives in the United Kingdom as the sea washed out dikes and flooded large areas during the day and into the night of 31 January. The worse was yet to come.

In addition a troop of field engineers from the Canadian army in Germany was detached for service in the Netherlands, and the RCAF flew relief flights into the country. One further result of the flooding was that the Canadian government eased immigration rules specifically for inhabitants of the stricken areas in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands, and more specifically farmers. One effect was that whole families could immigrate to Canada, rather than just heads of families. Starting 5 February, No. 426 Squadron North Stars made the first of four trips to Amsterdam.

Shortly after 9:00 AM, the Almirante Gago Countinho, guns at the ready, was observed circling the harbour and the Assiniboine. Assiniboine moved to a higher state of watertight readiness; however, by mid morning the tension was defused when the Coutinho elevated its guns skywards, indicating its neutrality in the coup attempt. About 10:25 AM, the commanding officer of Assiniboine took a small party ashore to meet the Canadian ambassador and seek guidance. Unfortunately, lack of knowledge about what was happening prevented the Ambassador from providing any specific instructions. What was known was that there appeared to be no direct threat to Canadians.

Fierce fighting ensued over the next two weeks, by the end of which Slovenia's territorial militia had defeated the JNA. On 7 July 1991, during a third visit to Yugoslavia by European Community (EC) representatives, a Cease Fire Agreement was negotiated between Slovenia and the remaining Yugoslav Republic. The Agreement, known as the Brioni Accord, established a cooling-off period of three months, while Federal (JNA) troops were to return to their barracks, and local Slovenian militia were deactivated. It also called for observers to monitor the ceasefire agreement and the withdrawal of JNA forces from Slovenia. With this agreement, the European Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM) was established. The staff of the ECMM was recruited from twelve EC countries as well as some member countries of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) (Canada, Sweden, Poland, Slovak Republic and Czech Republic).

At the same time, T\u201333s for use by the Air Division and as Mutual Aid gifts to NATO members were also ferried across the Atlantic, under the name Operation RANDOM. The first operation began on 11 February 1954, ferrying new Sabre Vs, while the last mission, Random 30 commenced on 24 June 1957, with 24 Sabre Vis and six T\u201333s. In just over three years of ferrying, No. 1 Overseas Ferry Unit, supported by 426 Squadron, safely delivered more than 800 aircraft overseas. No. 1 OFU also brought aircraft back to Canada. With the introduction of the Mk VI Sabre, the now surplus Mk Vs were either donated to other NATO members, or brought back to Canada. HMCS Magnificent left the UK with 50 Sabres on 7 Nov 56; while No. 1 OFU completed two ferrying operations from east to west across the North Atlantic \u2013 Operations RANDOM WEST I and II, on 17\u201319 Oct 56 (20 Sabre Vs) and 17\u201320 Nov 56 (16 Sabre Vs). (These operations were also referred to as REVERSE RANDOM.) When Belgium purchased 53 Avro CF\u2013100 Canucks, the RCAF delivered them in Operation JUMP MOAT. There were five missions under this op name, with the numbers 3 and 4 also bringing CF\u2013100s to the Air Division and number 5 being solely Air Division aircraft. The need to transfer aircraft to Europe did not end with Operation Random. In 1958, the need to ferry T\u201333s to NATO members under the Mutual Aid agreement produced operation STAR FLIGHT, with eight T\u201333s going to Greece and 17 T\u201333s going to Turkey. The aircraft, accompanied by two North Stars from No. 426 Sqn, departed on 9 May and returned to Canada on 22 May. 1959 was to prove a very busy year for ferrying aircraft to Europe. On 9 June, 12 T\u201333s piloted by members of No. 129 Acceptance and Ferry Flight and escorted by a 426 Squadron North Star departed Goose Bay for No. 4 Wing as part of Operation SILVER DOZEN. They arrived safely at Baden\u2013Sollingen on 15 June. A repeat of this operation was required in August, hence Operation SECOND SILVER DOZEN. This time, No. 129 AFF and No. 426 Sqn delivered 11 T\u201333s to No. 4 Wing. In September, Operation WESTERN WEAR ferried 22 T\u201333s to the Air Division, France, Greece, Portugal and Turkey. Pilots from No. 129 AFF were again accompanied by the familiar North Star from No. 426 Sqn, the operation starting 22 September and being completed with the return to Canada on 9 October. (This op was also referred to in RCAF files as Op Western Way.) Throughout the 1950s, the RCAF, under the authorization of the Government of Canada, provided aircraft to NATO allies under the Mutual Aid Agreement. In 1959, 19 Beech C\u201318 Expeditors were provided to France and another 6 to Portugal, flying to these countries under Operation BEECHFLIGHT. This operation started on 20 May and ended 4 June when the six Portuguese aircraft landed in that country. Each aircraft had a pilot and navigator, while a North Star from 426 Squadron carried the 12\u2013man support section. Operation Western Weft and Western Weal were conducted in 1962, delivering aircraft to France and Greece respectively. On this occasion 40 T\u201333s and 10 Expeditors were given to France, and 10 T\u201333s to Greece. This operation was conducted in five separate missions between 17 April and 3 August. The RCAF also ferried aircraft inside aircraft. As CF\u2013104 Starfighters were coming off the Canadair production line in Montreal, most were transported to Europe to equip No. 1 Air Division. These operations involved putting the CF\u2013104 inside one of the newly acquired C\u2013130 Hercules and flying it over in that manner. These operations, known as RHO DELTA, lasted from 1962 to 1965, ending when the last of the 185 CF\u2013104s had been delivered. (Rho Delta is ancient Greek for 100 \u2013Rho\u2013 and 4 \u2013 Delta)."}}, {"opName": "MAGNIFICENT", "countryRegion": "West Germany", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1957-02-02", "endDate": "1957-02-14", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/magnificent.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation MAGNIFICENT", "International Mission Name": "Operation MAGNIFICENT", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Europe", "Location": "West Germany", "Mission Date": "2 February 1957 - 14 February 1957", "Mission Mandate": "To return Canadair Sabre Vs to Canada. Mission/Operation Notes: Throughout the mid-1950s, the RCAF was improving the quality of its aircraft. A contract had been signed with Canadair to produce the North American F-86 Sabre under license in Montreal. As Canadair built newer, improved versions of these aircraft, they were flown to Europe to equip No. 1 Air Division. In 1956, the Mark VI Sabres flown to Europe created a surplus of Mark V aircraft, which had been allocated to the RCAF Auxiliary. The problem was how to get them back to Canada. In the autumn of 1956, the RCAF asked the Royal Canadian Navy to transport the Sabre Vs to Canada on the aircraft carrier HMCS Magnificent. The RCN agreed, with the task being given the name Operation Magnificent. On 7 November, Maggie was waiting to sail from Belfast for Glasgow to pick up 50 Sabres. At 2000 hours, she was ordered back to Halifax to pick up the Canadian contingent for the first United Nations Emergency Force. Having completed her delivery, Maggie returned to her previous task. On 2 February 1957, she hoisted 59 Sabres onboard - 48 on deck and 11 below. Severe storms enroute caused the ship to heave to on three consecutive nights. At one stage it was feared that some of the Sabres might break loose from their moorings. On 14 February she entered Halifax for the last time before she was paid off. The Sabres were off-loaded, thus ending Op Magnificent."}}, {"opName": "RHO DELTA", "countryRegion": "West Germany", "continent": "Europe", "startDate": "1962-09-01", "endDate": "1965-05-31", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/europe/rho-delta.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation RHO DELTA", "International Mission Name": "Operation RHO DELTA", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Europe", "Location": "West Germany", "Mission Date": "1 September 1962 - 31 May 1965", "Canadian Task Force Name Mission Statement": " To ferry RCAF aircraft to No. 1 RCAF Air Division in Europe.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " With the stand\u2013up of NATO and the emergence of the Cold War, Europe was seen as the next potential battleground, so much so that even the Korean War was seen as a diversion.

At the end of the Gulf War, the Security Council passed resolution 686, calling upon Iraq to comply with provisions concerning the treatment of hostages, prisoners of war and other measures. This was followed by Resolution 687 of 3 April 1991, which indicated that the full trade embargo would remain in place pending periodic reviews every 60 days of Iraqi compliance with the terms of the resolution. Canada decided to continue its participation in the embargo by providing one ship to hail and if required inspect merchant vessels heading towards Iraq. The embargo against Iraq was cancelled by Security Council resolution 1483, 22 May 2003 after the American-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nSince the Gulf War Canada had been participating in the enforcement of the UN Security Council resolutions embargoing specific goods against Iraq. While previous deployments had been given separate operation names, the next series of deployments in support of the Maritime Interdiction Force were given the name Op AUGMENTATION for all four rotations.\n\nOn 18 June 1999, HMCS Regina sailed from Esquimalt towards the Arabian Gulf as part of the USS Constellation Battle Group. The American and Canadian sailors were already familiar with each other, having conducted work-ups together in March and May in preparation for the deployment. Regina and the battle group entered the theatre of operations on 25 August. Over the next months, Regina conducted 97 hailings and 20 boardings of vessels, including two that were non-compliant (where the crew did not wish to allow the boarding), and escorted five violations breakers into port. On the humanitarian side, the ship found two Iranians whose small boat had broken down and had been adrift without food for four days. After repairing the engine and providing meals they were sent on their way. Regina left the operations area on 14 November, reaching Esquimalt on 16 December.\n\nThe next ship to participate in Op Augmentation was HMCS Calgary. The ship left Esquimalt on 20 June 2000. The ship arrived in the operations area on 15 July. Over the next three months and three patrols, the ship conducted 15 hailings and six boardings, before sailing from the theatre of operations on 8 October. On 16 August the Calgary was the on-scene controller for the rescue operations after the crash of helicopter at the Maersk Viking oil platform. The ship returned to Esquimalt on 30 November.\n\nHMC Ships participated in two Op Augmentation deployments in 2001 with HMCS Charlottetown and HMCS Winnipeg both deploying to the Arabian Gulf. These operations are normally referred to as Op Augmentation 2001-1 and 2001-2 respectively.\n\nHMCS Charlottetown departed Halifax on 12 January 2001 as part of the USS Harry S Truman Battle Group. This was the first time that an East Coast frigate had deployed with an American Battle Group. The ship entered the theatre of operations on 24 April and left on 15 June. In the intervening period, the ship conducted two patrols involving 151 hailings and 52 boarding, all of the latter with the cooperation of the ships involved. Charlottetown returned to Halifax on 1 July.\n\nWhile Charlottetown was still deployed, HMCS Winnipeg was tasked to deploy to the Arabian Gulf. Winnipeg departed Esquimalt on 14 March for operations in the Arabian Gulf as part of the USS Constellation Battle Group. After arriving in the operations area on 30 April, Winnipeg's tour in the Gulf was very busy, as was her sister ship. In five patrols the ship conducted 194 hailings, 57 compliant boardings and 4 non-compliant boardings. In addition there were health and comfort inspections of 162 ships. Winnipeg left the operations area on 10 August, arriving in Esquimalt on 14 September.\n\nWith the start of Operation APOLLO, the Campaign Against Terrorism after the September 11th attacks, Op Augmentation ceased.

After initial setbacks, Israel was able to regain lost ground. Along the Egyptian border, Israel initially suffered major setbacks; however, after a brilliant pincer movement, Israeli forces threatened to surround the entire Egyptian Third Army on the west bank of the Suez Canal. Diplomatic activity was intense during the conflict, with the possibility of a showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union. Egypt and Israel accepted a cease-fire along their border on 26 October. At the United Nations, the Security Council had made repeated calls for a cease-fire. On 25 October the Security Council again called for a cease-fire and authorized the UN Secretary-General to create a new United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF II). The same day, the Security Council approved a request from the Secretary-General to transfer peacekeeping contingents from the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) to Egypt. These forces would be under the temporary command of the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization (UNTSO) until the main UNEF II force could be deployed.\u00a0\n\nThe mandate of UNEF II was to supervise the implementation of the cease-fire and observe a return by the two forces to the positions they held as of 1650 hours, 22 October 1973. The force would attempt to prevent a recurrence of fighting and cooperate with the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization (UNTSO) and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\u00a0\n\nAustrian, Finnish and Swedish contingents began arriving on 26 October, supported a few days later by an Irish infantry company. The shape of the Canadian contingent, meanwhile, was a matter of discussion because of the USSR\u2019s insistence that Poland be involved. After two weeks of negotiations, it was agreed that Canada would provide a supply company, a maintenance company, a movement control unit, a postal detachment, and a radio unit, while Poland would provide a transport unit and a medical unit. In addition, Canada would provide an aviation unit for in-theatre transport.\u00a0\n\nWhile UNEF II was establishing itself in Egypt, discussions were occurring between Egyptian and Israeli military officers at the Kilometre 101 Tent on the Cairo-Suez City highway. This discussion produced an agreement on 24 January 1974 that detailed the disengagement and redeployment of the two forces, the creation of a buffer zone, the exchange of prisoners and the search, recovery and exchange of war dead.\u00a0\n\nBy 20 February 1974, UNEF II was up to its maximum strength of 6,973, with Canada providing the largest single contingent at 1,097, all ranks. (Eleven other nations were involved: Austria, Finland, Ghana, Indonesia, Ireland, Nepal, Panama, Peru, Poland, Senegal, and Sweden, with the Poles providing the second largest continent \u2013 822, all ranks.) UNEF II\u2019s strength began to decline when it provided personnel to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights in June 1974, and it fell further in 1975 when the contingents from Ireland, Nepal and Panama departed at the request of their governments. At the time of its withdrawal in July 1979, UNEF II had 4,031 personnel, with Poland now providing the largest contingent (923) and Canada the second largest (844). Joining the UNEF II observers on the front lines were 120 military observers from UNTSO. Their role was to support UNEF II and to use the UNTSO chain of command and responsibilities to assist in the resolution of problems.\u00a0\n\nUNEF II\u2019s operations fell into four distinct phases. The first phase lasted from October 1973 to January 1974, when the immediate task was to prevent any further violence between the major combatants and UN troops were interposed between them, manning observation posts and checkpoints and resupplying the Egyptian Third Army, which was still on the west bank of the Suez Canal.\u00a0\n\nThe second phase, which involved the withdrawal of forces, lasted from January 1974 to October 1975. Actual disengagement began on 25 January, and proceeded in carefully coordinated steps. As Israeli troops vacated an area UNEF II forces moved in to replace them before turning it over to Egyptian forces a few hours later. In this way a temporary buffer zone was always maintained. UNTSO personnel surveyed and marked the disengagement lines, with assistance from Egyptian and Israeli army surveyors. New checkpoints and observation posts were created and UNEF and UNTSO observers conducted inspections to ensure that troop limitations in the zone and armament were adhered to. These disengagement lines were maintained until October 1975, at which time a further agreement came into force.\u00a0\n\nPhase three resulted from a September 1975 agreement that called on Israel to withdraw eastward and Egyptian forces to withdraw westward from the Sinai Peninsula, thereby creating a large buffer zone between them. These withdrawals began in November 1975, with UNEF II personnel initially providing the channel of communications between the two sides and then creating new observation posts and checkpoints and conducting vehicle and aerial patrols to confirm compliance. This phase lasted until the signing of the Middle East Peace Treaty in March 1979 following the Camp David Accords of 17 September 1978.\u00a0\n\nThe last phase involved the application of the Middle East Peace Treaty. On 25 May, Israeli forces withdrew altogether from the Sinai, and UNEF II\u2019s task was now restricted to allowing Egyptian forces to pass through its lines. When that had been completed, UNEF II withdrew from the northern part of the buffer zone and subsequently began the task of withdrawing from that part of the theatre altogether.\u00a0\n\nAlthough UNEF II\u2019s mandate was not extended beyond 24 July 1979 some personnel remained in the region for a further five months to close down the mission. (10 November 1973 \u2013 31 October 1979)\u00a0\n\nCanadian participation in UNEF II began in November 1973 with the airlift of Canadian personnel to Egypt. Operation DANACA quickly reached a strength of 1100 personnel organised in five units: a Canadian component at UNEF Headquarters, 73 Canadian Service Battalion (Svc Bn \u2013 initially 73 Canadian Service Unit), 73 Canadian Signal Squadron (Sigs Sqn - initially 73 Canadian Signal Unit), 116 Canadian Air Transport Unit (ATU), and Canadian Contingent Administrative Unit Middle East.\u00a0\n\nThe role of the Canadian contingent was to provide second line administrative support to UNEF II contingents, in conjunction with the Polish logistics contingent. UNEF II headquarters was responsible for providing the third line support required by the Canadian and Polish contingents. With the creation of UNDOF, UNEF II became responsible for coordinating the movement of supplies and of postal services. UNEF II also coordinated the purchases for both missions.\u00a0\n\nOperation DANACA began with the departure of the first Canadian personnel from Trenton on 10 November. Over the next month, concluding on 7 December, almost all of the air force\u2019s Boeing and Hercules aircraft were involved in transporting the entire contingent and 1,500 tons of vehicles and cargo to Cairo. Indeed, the operational tempo meant that many squadron personnel approached the maximum allowable limit of flying hours for the period, and substitutes had to be found among aircrew posted to NDHQ and Air Transport Command Headquarters. Once on the ground, the Canadians set up camp at a racetrack on the outskirts of Cairo. The entire camp had to be built up from scratch. The first major UNEF tasking was to deliver food and water to the Egyptian Third Army. In this the Canadians had to operate without Polish support \u2013 the Israelis would not allow the Poles to pass through their lines because, at that time, Poland did not recognize the State of Israel.\u00a0\n\nNo 73 Cdn Sigs Unit was deployed at UNEF headquarters in Suez City in mid-November and had detachments with each UN battalion by mid-December. The task of communications was all the more important due to the multilingual nature of the UNEF contingent.\u00a0\n\nCanadian staff at UNEF headquarters conducted several reconnaissance trips into the Suez city area and the east bank of the Suez canal, in preparation for the eventual disengagement of the two forces and the withdrawal of the Israeli forces.\u00a0\n\nThe Canadian contingent to UNEF II was involved not only in the Sinai, but also in other operations in the Middle East. In June 1974, a composite logistics company from 73 Cdn Svc Bn, a troop from 73 Cdn Sigs Sqn and some staff and military police from UNEF Headquarters were detached to form the initial Canadian contribution to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights. In April 1978, Canada agreed to participate for a six-month period in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL \u2013 Canadian Operation ANGORA). The initial signals personnel for UNIFIL came from the Canadian contingent of UNEF II, as did some of the logistics personnel. They returned to UNEF with the arrival of the main body of Canadian personnel. 10 August 24 - December 1979\n\nWhen the UNEF II mandate was allowed to lapse, the Canadians played the primary role in closing out the mission. Between 24 July and 31 October, the contingent collected UNEF II materiel from the buffer zone and other operations areas. This was then prepared for return to Canada, storage, redistribution to other UN missions or disposal in Egypt. The name for this operation was Operation BUGLE. By 1 November, all Canadian personnel had departed, except a small rear party. These personnel remained until 19 December and were back in Canada on the 21st. Twenty-seven positions were transferred to UNDOF as part of the Canadian contingent administrative unit.\n"}}, {"opName": "DANACA", "countryRegion": "Egypt", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1973-10-25", "endDate": "1979-07-24", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/danaca.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Emergency Force II", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Emergency Force II (UNEF II)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Location": "Egypt", "Mission Date": "25 October 1973 - 24 July 1979", "Mission Mandate": " The United Nations Emergency Force II was created by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 340, on 25 October 1973.

After initial setbacks, Israel was able to regain lost ground. Along the Egyptian border, Israel initially suffered major setbacks; however, after a brilliant pincer movement, Israeli forces threatened to surround the entire Egyptian Third Army on the west bank of the Suez Canal. Diplomatic activity was intense during the conflict, with the possibility of a showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union. Egypt and Israel accepted a cease-fire along their border on 26 October. At the United Nations, the Security Council had made repeated calls for a cease-fire. On 25 October the Security Council again called for a cease-fire and authorized the UN Secretary-General to create a new United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF II). The same day, the Security Council approved a request from the Secretary-General to transfer peacekeeping contingents from the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) to Egypt. These forces would be under the temporary command of the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization (UNTSO) until the main UNEF II force could be deployed. The mandate of UNEF II was to supervise the implementation of the cease-fire and observe a return by the two forces to the positions they held as of 1650 hours, 22 October 1973. The force would attempt to prevent a recurrence of fighting and cooperate with the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization (UNTSO) and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Austrian, Finnish and Swedish contingents began arriving on 26 October, supported a few days later by an Irish infantry company. The shape of the Canadian contingent, meanwhile, was a matter of discussion because of the USSR\u2019s insistence that Poland be involved. After two weeks of negotiations, it was agreed that Canada would provide a supply company, a maintenance company, a movement control unit, a postal detachment, and a radio unit, while Poland would provide a transport unit and a medical unit. In addition, Canada would provide an aviation unit for in-theatre transport. While UNEF II was establishing itself in Egypt, discussions were occurring between Egyptian and Israeli military officers at the Kilometre 101 Tent on the Cairo-Suez City highway. These discussion produced an agreement on 24 January 1974 that detailed the disengagement and redeployment of the two forces, the creation of a buffer zone, the exchange of prisoners and the search, recovery and exchange of war dead. By 20 February 1974, UNEF II was up to its maximum strength of 6,973, with Canada providing the largest single contingent at 1,097, all ranks. (Eleven other nations were involved: Austria, Finland, Ghana, Indonesia, Ireland, Nepal, Panama, Peru, Poland, Senegal, and Sweden, with the Poles providing the second largest continent - 822, all ranks.)

One such glimmer occurred in September 1978 when, following meetings sponsored by the United States and embracing Egypt and Israel, the Camp David Accords marked the start of a process that would end a thirty-year long state of war between Israel and Egypt. Just six months later, on 26 March 1979 the Arab Republic of Egypt and the State of Israel signed the Treaty of Peace, which resulted in a phased Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula scheduled for completion by April 1982. During the period leading up to the signing of the treaty, it was understood by all concerned that the United Nations Security Council might not approve a standing peacekeeping force in the Sinai. Therefore, on March 26 1979, the day the Treaty of Peace was signed, US President Jimmy Carter sent identical letters to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin assuring both that the United States would take the necessary steps to ensure the establishment and maintenance of an alternative multinational force should the United Nations fail to assume this role. As had been foreseen, when the mandate of the United Nations Emergency Force II (UNEFII) -- which had been in existence since 1973 -- expired in July 1979, the United Nations had not agreed to provide the peacekeeping force envisioned by the Treaty of Peace. This left the existing U.S. Sinai Field Mission (SFM), which had been established to work in concert with the UN to observe the provisions of the Peace Accord to continue the monitoring process. Accordingly, the SFM monitored the Israeli withdrawal process until April 1982, when the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) was formed to succeed the SFM in accordance with Carter\u2019s promise and an agreement signed between the parties in August 1981. The SFM had divided the Sinai into four distinct zones, each of which had its own specific limits on the numbers and types of troops, ordnance, and fortifications that could be located there. The MFO, provided by ten countries, took over this structure. With headquarters in El Gorah, Egypt, it continued to monitor compliance with the peace treaty\u2019s security arrangements and to report violations by conducting patrols and operating checkpoints and observation posts along a strip of the eastern Sinai Peninsula twenty to forty kilometers wide and approximately 400 kilometers in length. Its area of responsibility also included the islands of Tiran and Sanafir in the Gulf of Aqaba, which were to be patrolled by naval units.", "Name": "CALUMET", "Date": "1 September 1985 - Present", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada was not an original contributor to MFO, but on 28 June 1985 Ottawa agreed to take over the duties of the Australian/New Zealand contingent the following spring. To this end, the Canadian Contingent MFO (CCMFO) was formed in September 1985 under Operation CALUMET. The initial Canadian unit to be deployed, 10 Tactical Aviation Group (10 TAG), consisted of 140 Canadian Forces (CF) personnel and nine CH-135 Twin Huey helicopters. Its advance parties began arriving in Egypt in February; one month later, on 31 March, the CCMFO took over command of its area from the Australian / New Zealand contingent. The Canadian contingent\u2019s duties included helicopter operations in support of observer inspections and verifications, infantry battalion support, VIP transport, medical evacuations, unit training, administrative and logistical tasks, command and control and search and rescue operations. The observers, mostly retired American military personnel and United States Department of State employees, usually carried out their inspections in teams of two and were dressed in bright orange uniforms. The Canadian Rotary Wing Aviation Unit (RWAU) was also responsible for the operation of the MFO\u2019s air traffic control system and any other missions agreed upon. The first unit to form the RWAU was 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron (THS) out of CFB Edmonton, followed in six-month rotations by 427 THS (Petawawa), 430 THS (Valcartier) and 403 Helicopter Operational Training Squadron (Gagetown). The Canadian helicopter unit was withdrawn in March 1990 when rotary wing support duties were handed over to an American unit. As a result, since 1990 the Canadian contingent\u2019s presence has been based on the contribution of approximately twenty-nine personnel at any time to serve with the MFO Headquarters in El Gorah, Egypt. Fourteen of these personnel serve on one-year tours of duty, the other fourteen on six-month tours.

Increases in taxes and the imposition of fines were used to make up for the decrease in oil revenues. Large portions of the populace resented the outflow of funds perceived to be buying American weapons, and some of the first demonstrations in 1978 leading to the revolution were against big banks with large foreign or minority ownership. Blue and white collar workers, the destitute, and the Shia clergy, each acting for their own reasons, came together in 1977-78, operating mainly in urban areas. With opposition strength rising, the Shah fled the country on 16 January 1979. At the same time, the army was drawn into the demonstrations, initially by refusing orders to fire on the crowds. Then, in January-February, 1979, some radical young officers, mostly from the Air Force, openly aligned themselves with the revolutionary forces. As a result of the civil unrest in Iran, the Department of External Affairs requested and the Government of Canada authorized the CF to provide aircraft for a potential evacuation of Canadian nationals from Iran. The staging point for the CF aircraft was Ankara, Turkey. Phase I involved the deployment of approximately 105 personnel to Ankara on 9 December 1978, arriving 10 December. These personnel set-up the Airlift Control Element in the hangar of a Turkish national handling company - USAK - at Ankara Airport. A temporary easing of tensions permitted the largest portion of personnel to return to Canada on 16 December 1978. Phase II involved the evacuation of Canadian and other foreign nationals. Aircraft were kept on 24 hour Notice to Move at CFB Trenton after Phase I, with a CC-137 and CC-130 departing on 31 December with only 4 hours Notice to Move. They arrived in Ankara on 1 January and 2 January respectively. A CC-130 from CFB Lahr departed that location arriving 2 January. Two other CC-130 departed CFB Trenton arriving in Ankara on 3 January. These two aircraft were then immediately serviced and departed for Tehran in under eight hours. On 3 January 1979, four flights were made into Tehran by four CC-130 aircraft. Three flights carried on to Rasht, on the Caspian Sea, to evacuate personnel, including some from the Montreal-based Stadler-Hurter Company. All told, the Canadian Forces evacuated 356 civilians: 227 Canadians, 56 West Germans, 43 British, 14 Americans, 6 Australians, 5 Finnish, 2 New Zealanders, 1 Czech and 2 of unknown nationality. A fifth flight on 4 January picked up 52 personnel. Due to the lateness of the aircraft\u2019s arrival, the curfew prevented evacuees from departing their homes for the trip to the airport, thereby forcing the aircraft to stay an extra night. The next morning, Iranian customs created delays that prolonged the stay of the aircraft. In the end, it picked up 39 Canadian, 10 British, 1 American, 1 Australian, and 1 New Zealander. With this last flight of Phase II, the personnel commenced the redeployment phase, with the last aircraft departing Ankara at 1800 local, 6 January 1979. Op BATON was not over however. A final flight was arranged in late January 1979, with the belief that 160 personnel required evacuation. This was Phase III of Op BATON. One Hercules was involved, departing CFB Trenton on 31 January and returning 8 February. As with previous missions, Iranian authorities created a 72-hour delay in flying to Tehran.

Because of these broader implications, it was during this period that the United Nations began to work to bring resolution to the conflict. In 1984, for example, the UN established a presence in both Baghdad and Teheran when it seconded two teams of three officers from personnel tasked to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), and one senior official of the United Nations Secretariat. In time, the UN\u2019s diplomatic efforts paid dividends. In July 1987 the Secretary General was able to engage the Security Council in the peacemaking process, and within six days it generated a plan through Resolution 598 to arrange a cease-fire and a subsequent withdrawal of all forces to the internationally recognised borders between Iraq and Iran. The United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) would monitor compliance and chair a dispute resolution group - but due to intransigence on both sides, in the end the latter would meet only once.", "Name": "VAGABOND", "Date": "8 August 1988 - 28 February 1991", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Under the designation Operation VAGABOND, Canada announced that it would contributed to UNIIMOG on 8 August 1988. Just two days later, a reconnaissance party of five left for the operational area; the entire contingent, including fifteen UNMOs and a communications unit of approximately five hundred soldiers and 150 vehicles would follow soon thereafter. The UNMOs were to establish the cease-fire lines, monitor compliance with the cease-fire, investigate any violations of the same and supervise the withdrawal of all Iranian and Iraqi military forces to their own territory. The communications unit - 88 Canadian Signals Squadron - was formed specifically for this operation, primarily from troops based at Canadian Forces Bases Petawawa and Kingston. Its task was to set up a communications system in both Iran and Iraq for use by UNIIMOG civilian staff members. By March 1989 the Canadian signallers had completed their task and were on their way back to Canada. In January 1991, the two parties agreed to convene a technical meeting of military experts to discuss and resolve the issue of disputed positions along the internationally recognized borders between the countries. By the end of the month the Iranian Army had withdrawn from thirteen of seventeen disputed positions and Iraq had left twenty-three of twenty-nine such positions - all under the watchful eyes of the UNMOs. With UNIIMOG\u2019s mandate about to expire, the Secretary General recommended that it be extended one month to allow supervision of the withdrawal of the belligerent forces from the remaining positions. That occurred in Iran, but before the work could be completed in Iraq the UN had to withdraw its forces because of the impending conflict following Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait."}}, {"opName": "ASSIST", "countryRegion": "Iran, Iraq and Turkey", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1991-04-09", "endDate": "1991-06-08", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/assist.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation PROVIDE COMFORT (II)", "International Mission Name": "Operation PROVIDE COMFORT (II)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Location": "Iran, Iraq and Turkey", "Mission Date": "9 April 1991 - 8 June 1991", "Mission Mandate": " Operation PROVIDE COMFORT was a United States-led operation, given approval through UN Security Council Resolution 688 (5 April 1991).

Iraq was required to turn over all such weapons and allow inspections to ensure that it undertook no further such development. A UN Special Commission was to be established that would take possession of these weapons, destroy them, and verify compliance with the Resolution.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " In the 1980s Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction programmes came into the international spotlight. During the Iran-Iraq War (22 September 1980 to 20 August 1988), Iraq used chemical weapons to halt an Iranian offensive and then used these weapons against Iraqi Kurds. The toxic agents employed included cyanide, mustard gas, sarin, tabun and VX - and some at least had been adapted to a variety of munitions including artillery and mortar shells, aerial bombs as well as missile and rocket warheads. Iraq was also suspected of developing biological weapons, among them anthrax, botulinum and aflatoxin, and producing them in quantity. It was against this backdrop that the Gulf War was waged in 1990/91. Accordingly, when Iraq surrendered in March 1991 and agreed to abide by UN Resolutions, these included provisions to prevent any subsequent production and use of chemical and biological agents. This was made clear in Security Council Resolution 687 of 3 April 1991, which created a UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) under Chapter VII to which Iraq had to declare all of its biological, chemical, and missile holdings and under whose supervision these would be destroyed. Iraq was also to undertake no further development of such weapons, with UNSCOM monitoring and verifying its compliance. Iraq accepted these terms and conditions on 18 April 1991. The destruction of Iraq\u2019s nuclear weapons programme fell to the International Atomic Energy Agency, with UNSCOM\u2019s assistance. Iraq also agreed to allow UNSCOM inspectors unrestricted access and egress to all sites, equipment and personnel, as well as other unrestricted rights in support of UNSCOM\u2019s mandate.\u00a0\n\nUNSCOM operations were planned and managed from UN headquarters in New York. An office in Bahrain served as a logistics and training point, while the office in Baghdad was responsible for the maintenance and operation of the monitoring system and was the base of operations for inspection teams. UNSCOM personnel in Baghdad not only undertook inspections of facilities and locations of interest but were also responsible for the supervision of the monitoring equipment installed at certain facilities. When required, UNSCOM could also call upon specialist personnel to assist in inspections and other UNSCOM operations.\u00a0\n\nIraq\u2019s compliance with UN Resolution 687 was at best grudging and, at worst, non-existent. UNSCOM were hindered as they tried to conduct inspections, and at least twice, in March and November 1995, \u201cFull Final and Complete Disclosures\u201d provided by the Iraqi government to the UN proved to be total fabrications. Biological, chemical, and nuclear programmes all continued to exist - in part because the Iraqi government received advance warning of impending inspections and therefore dismantled sites before UNSCOM teams arrived. It is thought that spies and electronic eavesdropping provided such warnings.\u00a0\n\nAs the level of obstruction increased, coalition partners from the 1991 war began to gather forces together in the region with the seeming intent of launching non-UN-sanctioned air strikes on Iraq. The UN Secretary General managed to defuse tensions in February 1998, but only a few months later, in October, Iraq suspended all cooperation with UNSCOM. Although this order was rescinded a month later, UNSCOM evacuated its personnel from Iraq on 16 December and did not return. Shortly thereafter, American and British air forces conducted four days of air strikes on Iraqi facilities (Operation DESERT FOX).\u00a0\n\nDuring its lifetime, UNSCOM conducted over 250 inspection missions, conducted by over 1000 individuals from 40 countries. It found and destroyed almost 40,000 chemical weapons munitions, 690 tonnes of chemical weapons agents, a biological weapons production facility and 48 SCUD missiles. But significant quantities of chemicals and delivery systems remained unaccounted for.\u00a0\n\nIn December 1999, the Security Council terminated UNSCOM and replaced it with the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC). Although UNMOVIC had the same mandate as UNSCOM, its method of operation would be radically different.", "Name": "FORUM", "Date": "10 April 1991 - 30 April 2000", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " Canada agreed to participate in UNSCOM on 10 April 1991, with personnel arriving in May under the name Operation FORUM. About 20 Canadian civilian and military experts were in Iraq in the first stages of UNSCOM\u2019s operations, most working at the Al Muthanna facility near Baghdad, a site containing stockpiles of chemical munitions, Sarin being the most common agent found. This first visit identified the work required to ensure the destruction of the agents. A second visit in September destroyed those shells that had no harmful chemicals, while a third visit from October to December 1991 destroyed the remaining shells. This was not without its risks. One shell detonated of its own volition, spraying an Iraqi worker with toxic materials. Only the quick intervention of personnel on site, with the administration of large doses of atropine, saved his life. Canadians remained active at Al Muthanna into 1994. Other dangerous incidents did not involve weapons of mass destruction. In September 1991, five Canadians were part of a 44-member international inspection team that discovered documents relating to nuclear weapons production. They were taken hostage by Iraq, requiring four days of international negotiations before the team and the documents were allowed to leave.\u00a0\n\nIn October 1991 the decision was made that Canadian participation would consist of a maximum of 12 personnel at any given time. This participation would include permanent staff at UNSCOM headquarters, inspection and support staff, and specialists who would operate an incinerator provided by the Defence Research Establishment at Suffield, Alberta. They would be selected from across the Canadian Forces and Department of National Defence.\u00a0\n\nOne vital task was the disposal of explosives, and Canadian Explosives Ordnance Disposal personnel served on both UNSCOM inspection teams and the Chemical Destruction Group. Although the main responsibility of the EOD specialists was to offer advice on the safe destruction of particular weapons systems and substances - Iraq was to undertake the actual destruction, under UNSCOM supervision - from time to time CF personnel did destroy some weapons. For its part, the CDG concentrated on finding, identifying, and destroying chemical weapons and related production and storage sites. Canadian military and civilian personnel also served with UNSCOM\u2019s Chemical Destruction Group (CDG), tasked with identifying weapons systems containing chemical weapons, identifying chemical weapons production and storage sites and destructing these weapons and sites. Tours generally ranged between three and six months, although some were deployed for as long as 18 months, and some for as little as two weeks. Some Canadians exceeded ten distinct deployments to UNSCOM. Meanwhile, a Canadian lieutenant-colonel set up the intelligence cell at UNSCOM headquarters, where good use was made of imagery provided by helicopters and American U-2 photographic reconnaissance aircraft.\u00a0\n\nBy the end of 1992, over 45 DND/CF military and civilian personnel had participated in UNSCOM. Canadian participation in Iraq itself ended in November 1998 with the withdrawal of UNSCOM from that country, but Canadians remained at UNSCOM\u2019s New York headquarters until the end of the mission\u2019s mandate on 17 December 1999.

Some Kurdish groups had been waging a decades-long campaign against Iran, Iraq and Turkey, demanding the establishment of a separate Kurdish state - Kurdistan. Encouraged by American radio broadcasts that seemed to urge a revolt against the defeated Saddam Hussein, Iraqi Kurds did so, expecting American assistance. In March 1991, Kurdish rebels seized and controlled a large area in the north. The Iraqi military struck back with force, and quickly recovered much of the lost ground. Fearing for their safety, over one million Kurds fled the area, into the mountains of Iran, Iraq and Turkey. The conditions in this region were austere, creating a situation that, by the start of April, was resulting in the deaths of an estimated 800 - 1000 a day. In the face of this crisis, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 688 (5 April 1991), which requested that Iraq halt the repression and that member states assist in humanitarian relief efforts. In support of this effort, the United States launched Operation PROVIDE COMFORT on 6 April, operating from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. British and French cargo aircraft arrived the next day, with more from another 10 nations arriving soon thereafter. Operation PROVIDE COMFORT actually consisted of two components: a relief operation, which included Canadian participation under Operation ASSIST and Operation REGARD, and a security operation, to ensure that Iraq could not interfere with the relief efforts. The security operation also included a no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel in which all Iraqi aircraft were banned. To back up both components, American A-10 aircraft preceded relief aircraft to ensure that Iraqi ground troops did not take action, while F-15 and F-16 fighters were available to counter any Iraqi aerial threat. Overhead, an E-3 AWACS monitored the situation and controlled the supporting aircraft.

Although the Shi\u2019ite are the majority in Iraq, they suffered repression from the regime, including religious repression. The Iraqi military started a campaign to end the insurrection, using helicopters and enforcing their will with repressive measures. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 688 (5 April 1991) calling upon Iraq to end the repression of its population and allow humanitarian agencies to provide assistance. While Iraq chose in some measure to abide by the Resolution in northern Iraq where the Kurds had also rebelled, it did not do so in the south. But because international attention was focused upon the Kurds and their plight, the Shi\u2019ites\u2019 in the south continued to be targeted by the Iraqi military and received little support.\n\nAfter consultation with a number of coalition partners, on 26 August 1992 American President George Bush announced the creation of a no-fly zone in southern Iraq, below the 32nd parallel (moved to the 33rd parallel in 1996). All Iraqi fixed and rotary wing aircraft were banned from flights in the no-fly zone. Operation SOUTHERN WATCH was created with this announcement. Most of the subsequent two years passed with few Iraqi violations of the ban; however, Saddam Hussein\u2019s threats of violence against neighboring states, as a means to end sanctions against Iraq, created apprehension among the Gulf States and in the United Nations.\n\nOn 15 October 1994, the Security Council passed Resolution 949 demanding that Iraq withdraw its forces from its southern borders and that it not threaten neighbors or UN operations. This was backed up by the use of Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Operation SOUTHERN WATCH henceforth had Chapter VII backing to ensure that Iraq did not deploy any new units into the southern border region, and that it not use military force to threaten its neighbors or UN operations. Among the nations participating were the United States, Britain, France and Saudi Arabia, with support from 22 other nations.\u00a0\n\nInitially, American, British and French forces conducted the AWACS patrols. After 15 December 1996, France withdrew from the AWACS operations, although it continued to support Coalition operations in the Persian Gulf with men and equipment. The AWACS monitored the airspace in and north of the no-fly zone, watching for Iraqi attempts to violate the zone or lure Coalition into surface-to-air missile traps. AWACS also controlled Coalition air strikes against Iraq in December 1998 after Iraq expelled UN arms inspectors (Operation DESERT FOX).\u00a0\n\nCanada\u2019s participation in Operation Southern Watch stems from participation in AWACS operations during and after the Gulf War.

In the aftermath, various UN Security Council resolutions have authorized embargoes, sanctions and inspections of Iraq. To many nations, but particularly the United States, Iraq appeared to be violating the agreements and resolutions that had been signed at the end of the first Gulf War and passed since that date. On several occasions, coalition forces had attacked Iraq. In the end, citing non-compliance with on the issue of weapons of mass destruction, the United States led an invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The result was the defeat of Iraq militarily, but not an end to a guerrilla-like insurgency. Iraq also faced a host of political, economic and social problems as it attempted to cope with its post-Saddam Hussein future.\u00a0\n\nThrough Resolution 1483, the Security Council hoped that the UN could play a role in building a new and inclusive Iraqi society and to this end various UN agencies began operations there. To coordinate the UN effort, the Security Council authorized the creation of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) on 14 August 2003 (Resolution 1500). At least seven UN offices would be created, besides those UN organizations such as UNICEF, UNDP and OCHA that were already present in Iraq.\u00a0\n\nOn 19 August 2003, insurgents detonated a car bomb outside the office of the UN\u2019s Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) in Iraq. In the resulting explosion, 22 members of UNAMI were killed. The SRSG, Sergio Vieira de Mello, was killed and the greater part of the human rights and political works office destroyed. The UN subsequently withdrew most UNAMI personnel from Iraq and in December appointed an acting-SRSG, Ross Mountain.\n\nWhile the UNAMI personnel in Iraq remained at minimal levels, UNAMI increased its presence in Cyprus, Jordan and Kuwait to support efforts in Iraq. Greater emphasis was placed on Iraqis assisting themselves while the UN found new ways to improve its support to the people of Iraq. UNAMI staff also began planning for an eventual UN return to Iraq.\n\nOn 8 June 2004, the Security Council approved Resolution 1546.

In response, Fiji provided 157 troops protecting 64 international UNAMI personnel and an unenumerated number of Iraqis. A further 70 UNAMI personnel were based in Cyprus, Jordan and Kuwait.

Four sailors from the United Arab Emirates navy were embarked for two days for familiarization. The patrol terminated with a visit to Qatar, where they hosted a cocktail party for Qatari guests and Canadian expatriots.

HMCS Regina began work-ups for the operation in January 1997, departing Esquimalt on 21 February as part of a Surface Action Group (SAG) with the United States Navy. A port call in Hong Kong saw the ship provide two guards of honour at two Commonwealth Cemeteries to pay respect to those who fell in the defence of Hong Kong during the Second World War.\u00a0\n\nOn 3 April, HMCS Regina officially came under the operational command of the United States Fifth Fleet in the Arabian Gulf. The SAG transited the Straits of Hormuz on the 6th, coming alongside Manama, Bahrain the next day. Unfortunately, because of terrorist threats against United States military personnel, there was no shore leave. Departing Manama on the 12th for her northern patrol area, Regina quickly integrated herself into a patrol system that included American and Dutch warships. While Regina\u2019s boarding party checked the cargo on some larger merchant vessels, most of the inspected vessels were small cargo dhows of around 250 to 500 tons.\u00a0\n\nThe first patrol ended with a port visit to Port Rashid, Dubai on 22 April. The crew enjoyed an excellent run ashore before departing for the patrol area on the 26th. On this patrol one previous sanctions violator, the MV Qabas II, was caught by Regina. This second patrol ended with a Port call to Kuwait City on 6 May and a reception in support of the Canadian Embassy. The third patrol commenced on 10 May and was marked by seven boardings in one day (11 May). With a Toronto Star journalist embarked for patrols two and three, these boardings and the detection and detention of two embargo violators received international publicity, as well as providing a big boast to the ship\u2019s morale. After this flurry of activity, the ship\u2019s crew enjoyed a 10-day rest and maintenance period in Dubai, starting on the 19th. Regina departed Dubai on the 29th bound for a new patrol area, the eastern sector of the Gulf. This was a quiet area, and only one boarding was conducted. The fourth patrol concluded with a visit to Abu Dhabi on 6 June. Here, the Canadian ship served as a goodwill ambassador, playing host to a reception held by the Canadian Ambassador.\u00a0\n\nWith the Commander Maritime Forces Pacific, Rear-Admiral R.D. Moore, and Commander Maritime Operations Group Two, Captain (N) R.G. Allen, embarked, Regina departed on her fifth patrol on 10 June. Over the next eight days, 11 ships were boarded, before returning to Dubai on the 19th. The sixth and last patrol started on 23 June, ending on the 30th, this time in the familiar waters of the northern Gulf. During this time a further nine boardings were undertaken.\u00a0\n\nRegina\u2019s Sea King was a key part of the ship\u2019s equipment, extending the range of her sensors, while also conducting medical evacuations (medevacs), helicopter replenishments and personnel transfers. Perhaps of greater importance, the Sea King could check out vessels and advice Regina\u2019s boarding party of any unusual or suspicious behaviour, including the possibility of weapons being deployed. After four months of hard flying, serviceability became an issue, and the aircrew twice had to declare in-flight emergencies on the final patrol.\u00a0\n\nAfter transiting the Straits of Hormuz on 2 July and a port visit to Muscat, Oman, Regina officially departed the operations area on 9 July. Making several port calls in Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii on the way home, Regina returned to Esquimalt on 20 August.

Kuwait was occupied in less than a day.\n\nThe United States immediately began to put together a coalition to protect Saudi Arabia and its oil fields, and to persuade Iraq to leave Kuwait. Indeed, on 7 August Saudi Arabia asked the US to station American troops on its territory to protect the Kingdom.\n\nThe United Nations also took up the issue. On 2 August the Security Council approved Resolution 660, which asserted that Iraq posed a threat to peace and demanded that it withdraw its forces from Kuwait. When no progress was made, resolution No. 661 was passed on 6 August, launching an embargo against all transactions with Iraq, except for the delivery of medical supplies and foodstuffs. This was a Chapter VII resolution.\n\nWith the embargo having limited effect, the Security Council passed Resolution No. 665 on 25 August under Chapter VII authorizing maritime forces to use measures commensurate with enforcing Resolution 661. The final significant act was Resolution 678 passed on 29 November. It authorized the use of force to ensure Iraqi compliance with all Security Council resolutions if Iraq did not withdraw from Kuwait by 15 January 1991.\n\nThe Iraqi military seemed to pose a significant threat. The army had over 1,000,000 soldiers, including the Republican Guard of almost 80,000 troops. The army had over 5,500 tanks, including the most modern T-72s, and over 3,000 artillery pieces. The Iraqi Air Force was assessed as having a highly credible capability. In terms of equipments, it had over 750 French and Soviet aircraft including 500 fighters and fighter-bombers. These included Mirage F-1, MiG- 21, MiG-23, MiG-25 and MiG-29 fighter and interceptor aircraft and Sukhoi Su-20/22 and Su-25 close support aircraft. In addition, the air defence system included some modern and capable French and Soviet equipment.\n\nOffensively, Iraq fielded a variety of surface-to-surface missiles, including Scuds, and while these were not the most accurate types, they could reach targets as far away as Israel.\n\nMost worrisome was the fact that Iraq was known to have chemical weapons \u2013 blister agents like mustard gas as well as nerve agents like sarin and tabun \u2013 and the means of delivering them. And of course, such weapons had been used intentionally in the long drawn-out war against Iran.\n\nAlthough efforts at finding a negotiated settlement continued, coalition forces gathered strength in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States from August 1990 to January 1991. Ultimately, Security Council Resolution 678 gave Iraq until 15 January to withdraw its forces from Kuwait. That did not happen, and at 0300 Baghdad time on 17 January 1991, an air campaign was launched against Iraqi military targets in Kuwait and Iraq. Designated Operation Desert Storm, at the outset the air campaign was designed to destroy Iraq\u2019s command, control, and communications infrastructure and its air defence system. Fielded forces were attacked thereafter. For its part, Iraq launched its first Scud against Saudi Arabia on 17 January, and began blowing up oil wells in Kuwait on 22 February.\n\nThe ground war commenced on 24 February, and coalition forces made rapid progress against Iraqi troops, which had been shattered by over a month of aerial bombardment. The next day Iraq launched Scud missiles against Israel in attempt to draw that country into the fighting and, perhaps, break-up the US-led coalition. Israel did not take the bait, and by 28 February, after just 100 hours of ground operations, the Iraqis had been pushed out of Kuwait. US President George H. Bush declared a unilateral cease-fire that same day; Iraq agreed to abide by the terms and the UN Resolutions on 3 March, and the official cease-fire came into effect on 6 April.", "Name": "Op SCIMITAR", "Date": "15 September 1990 - 6 November 1990", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " While the Canadian warships were on their way to the Persian Gulf, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced on 14 September 1990 that Canada would also contribute CF-18s to provide air cover for the Canadian warships.

The CF-18s came from 409 Squadron at CFB Baden, Germany, augmented by aircraft and personnel from 421 and 439 Squadrons and supported by 1 Air Maintenance Squadron. In preparation for the move, 22 Hercules and Boeing flights were made between 20 and 24 September to transport required supplies from Canada to Baden.

These included Mirage F-1, MiG- 21, MiG-23, MiG-25 and MiG-29 fighter and interceptor aircraft and Sukhoi Su-20/22 and Su-25 close support aircraft.

Operation ACCORD was the designation given to the creation and transportation of the headquarters. Mobile and Communications Commands provided 60 percent of the 160 personnel for the newly created 90 Headquarters and Signals Squadron. Personnel from 93 different units began gathering at CFB Kingston for training on 13 October. A recce team arrived in Manamah, Bahrain on 14 October, scouting locations for the new headquarters.

Other options had been considered, but the Army was occupied with planning for possible participation in resolving the Oka Crisis (what became Op Salon) while the Air Force was committed to Europe and the potentially unstabilizing events following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. Cabinet decided, after input from the Canadian Forces, to send HMC Ships Protecteur, Athabaskan and Terra Nova, but they would require some new equipment to meet the potential threats posed by Iraqi forces. These included installing Phalanx close-in-weapons-systems, chaff systems and electronic suites. The latter was perhaps one of the more significant installations, as the British BRAHMS secure communications systems allowed the Canadians to communicate with the Royal Navy and the Australian and Dutch navies while at the same time using the already installed STU III system to talk with the United States Navy. HMC Ships could thus become a conduit between various navies.\nAlong with the major systems, six Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns were fitted - two on each ship. These provided anti-aircraft defence and surface mine destruction capabilities, as well as being useful for boarding operations. They sailed under the name Operation FRICTION.\n\nSailing with the ships were three nine-man detachments from 119 Air Defence Battery, equipped with the newly acquired Javelin low level surface to air missile. Five Sea King helicopters from 423 Squadron provided air coverage for the ships. Eleven major systems were identified as requiring upgrade or installation, including forward looking infra-red (FLIR), global positioning system (GPS), and various threat warning devices. What was considered to be an 18-month peacetime refit was completed in eight days.\n\nThe ships, with embarked personnel from 119 Air Defence Battery and 423 Squadron, sailed from Halifax on 24 August. They arrived in Bahrain on 27 September, having conducted numerous training exercises en-route. On 1 October 1990 HMC Ships Athabaskan and Terra Nova started interception and inspection operations in support of UN resolution 661. With two ships on station at any one time, the three Canadian ships conducted over 100 interceptions and hailings in the first week alone. By the start of offensive operations, the three Canadian ships had conducted over one quarter of all interceptions (1644 of 6103) while comprising less than 10 percent of the ships in the Maritime Interdiction Force (MIF). The Sea Kings were also to make a significant contribution, as they had a longer endurance than most helicopters embarked on MIF vessels, and the Forward Looking Infra Red provided a much-valued night-time capability in detecting smaller vessels at night.\n\nThese operations were conducted in the central Arabian Gulf, where the Canadian ships could provide the maximum contribution. HMCS Protecteur was the only auxiliary vessel in the Coalition fleet that was conducting interception operations \u2013 this was a role assumed by warships of other navies. Protecteur\u2019s wide selection of refuelling nozzles, which allowed her to replenish all customers, obviating the need for them to return to port, added immeasurably to her value in-theatre.\u00a0\n\nCanada\u2019s commitment to Gulf operations increased on 14 September, when the Prime Minister announced that the CF would provide a squadron of fighter aircraft to provide Combat Air Patrols (CAP) for the Canadian ships in the Gulf. These aircraft came from 409 Squadron in Baden, augmented by aircraft and personnel from 421 and 439 Squadrons. The last of the 16 aircraft arrived in Doha, Qatar on 12 October, through Operation SCIMITAR.\n\nTwo days later Canadian CF-18s began to conduct patrols in area Whiskey 2 - the Coalition fleet\u2019s second line of air defence \u2013 and turned back an Iraqi two-aircraft patrol. Within two weeks, having by then figured out how they could be fully integrated into the US \u2013 led air defence scheme and operations, they replaced US Marine Corps F-18s patrolling in area Whiskey-1, a front-line sector. Further proof of Canadian capabilities came when they were tasked to provide CAP for the US Navy aircraft carrier Midway while it was transiting through the Straits of Hormuz. The carrier was prohibited from launching its own CAP while in the Straits.\u00a0\n\nSecurity at Doha was provided by \u201cM\u201d Company, 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment from CFB Lahr, Germany. The 118 personnel were responsible for security of the Canadian facilities at Doha, building defensive positions and observation posts and erecting fences. Four Grizzly wheeled vehicles were brought over from Canada to provide support for night-time patrols and security checks. The Grizzlies soon proved so useful that they were integrated into the allied patrols for the Doha airbase. In December, M Company was replaced by \u201cC\u201d Company, 1st Battalion, Le Royal 22e R\u00e9giment from Lahr.\n\nOn 6 November, Commodore K.J. Summers assumed command of all Canadian units and personnel in the Middle East: his Headquarters operated under the name Headquarters Canadian Force s-Middle East (HQ CANFORME). Creation and deployment of the headquarters was under Operation ACCORD. At this time the CF-18 aircraft officially became part of Operation FRICTION.\n\nBesides the CF-18s and resupply flights, the air force also provided in-theatre transport and air-to-air refuelling, while 412 Squadron maintained a CC-144 Challenger aircraft in theatre supported by 3 pilots, 2 flight engineers and 8 other personnel to provide local transport for the Canadian headquarters. The Challenger flew over 300 hours in support of this mission.\n\nIn preparation for the air war, 437 Squadron deployed its only CC-137 Boeing air-to-air refuelling aircraft on 6 January. Over the course of Op FRICTION, the AAR Boeings passed over 2,000 tons of fuel to coalition aircraft in 87 missions, of which 87 percent was to Canadian aircraft.\n\nAbout forty Canadian sailors, soldiers, airmen and airwomen served individually with foreign forces in the Gulf as part of their normal exchange duties. These included the US Navy, Royal Navy and French Navy, US Air Force transport and AWACS squadrons and Royal Air Force fighter squadrons, as well as British armoured and signals regiments.\n\nWhen the US Navy indicated that it would send the hospital ships Comfort and Mercy to the Gulf, US Medical Reserves were called up. Even then, the ships were understaffed. Canada responded by offering a nine-person medical team in return for Canadian personnel having access to the US medical system. These nine personnel joined Mercy in the Persian Gulf on 19 September and remained until early January 1991 at which time they were replaced by another nine-person team who remained for the duration of the conflict.\n\nA further contribution of medical personnel was made to the Bahraini Defence Force (BDF). When it was found out that the extra medical staff on HMCS Protecteur were not required to meet her needs, an arrangement was therefore made with the BDF that the nine officers and non-commissioned members would serve with BDF doctors.\u00a0\n\nOften overlooked was the presence of 15 Canadians in Iraq as part of the 350 person United Nations Iran Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG), there to observe the disengagement of Iranian and Iraqi forces after the Iranian-Iraq War ceasefire of 1988. In September the UN reduced the size of UNIIMOG by 40 percent, with nine Canadians remaining. In January 1991, with tensions increasing as the deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait approached, the last of the UNIIMOG observers were withdrawn.\n\nAs the threat of war loomed, Canadian political and military authorities ensured that, in contrast to the Korean Conflict, Canada\u2019s naval contribution would remain an organically unified entity rather than see HMC Ships dispersed to US and British commands for individual assignments. The air force contribution was already well integrated into the coalition, but it would be increased to twenty-four aircraft and about 550 men and women. Pilots from 421 and 439 Squadrons in Baden and 416 Squadron in Cold Lake replaced the initial deployments.\n\nThe air war began the night of 16 January with the CF-18s flying CAP, in Whiskey \u2013 1 and immediately raised the chance of blue-on-blue conflict when allied pilots returning from offensive operations entered the Canadian patrol area without having turned on their Identification \u2013 Friend \u2013 Foe (IFF) transmitters. All these aircraft had to be intercepted and positively identified as friendlies \u2013 at night, often with closing speeds of Mach 2 \u2013 and no mistakes were made. This CAP of Whiskey-1 was almost exclusively Canadian until 19 January, at which time the arrival of two more American aircraft carriers allowed the Canadians to reduce their flying hours.\n\nStarting 20 January, the Canadians started \u201csweep and escort\u201d missions. CF-18s would sweep ahead of a group of attack bombers to ensure that the area was clear of enemy aircraft. Other CF-18s would provide close escort to manage any threats that popped up after the sweep aircraft had passed. These missions were not without risk. The anti-aircraft fire over Iraq was intense; the Iraqi forces also appeared to have a surplus of surface-to-air missiles, many of which were spotted approaching Canadian aircraft. Luckily, the missiles dropped away at the last minute, falling short.\n\nOn 30 January two CF-18s were diverted to attack an Iraqi fast patrol boat that had managed to escape destruction by other aircraft. After two strafing runs with the CF-18s 20 mm guns, the boat was irreparably damaged and later found to have sought safe-haven in Iran.\u00a0\n\nIn mid-February, plans were underway at National Defence Headquarters for the CF-18s to take on a more offensive role \u2013 attacking Iraqi targets on the ground. To provide the necessary bombs, Operation IRON SABRE (see separate entry) was initiated on 22 February. Two days later the CF-18s conducted their first bombing run, dropping thirty-two Mk 82 500 lbs bomb, and it was intended that they would conduct between eight and sixteen sorties a day for up to thirty-two days. However, hostilities would end on 28 February, and as a result the CF-18s conducted only 56 bombing missions.\n\nThey navy would also change its role. With the onset of hostilities, few merchant vessels would be sailing in the war zone, which meant that there was less need for maritime interdiction. But because the Canadian ships lacked all \u2018round air defence weapons, they could not operate where the threat of air attack on ships or the use of Exocet missiles was high. At a meeting on 9 January the Canadian representative proposed that Canada act as the coordinator of the combat logistics force.\n\nThe Canadian ships were more than adequate to provide security for the logistics vessels that would replenish the carrier battle groups and other combatants, while the communications suite in the Canadian ships allowed them to communicate with all other navies. The commander of the Canadian Task Group, Captain (N) D.E. Miller, became the only non-US Navy officer to hold the position of Subordinate Warfare Commander during the conflict.\n\nIn mid-February carrier operations moved farther north in the Gulf as the threat from Iraqi forces had been considerably reduced. The threat to the CLF was also reduced and the supply vessels were able to move north with the carriers, with no further escort required. However, the United States Navy still wanted Canada to continue in the role of middleman and coordinating vessel movements. This time they concentrated on controlling the merchant vessels moving to and from ports in the Gulf that were not affected by the conflict and ensured that all ships were identified and stayed in their designated sea-lanes. The Canadian Task Group coordinated the picket ships stationed along the sea-lanes, which considerably eased the workload.\n\nHMCS Protecteur, whose original crew had been replaced by the crew of HMCS Preserver in January, took on the task of replenishing the ships on picket duty and made three such trips before the ceasefire was declared. Meanwhile, HMCS Athabaskan twice went into the northern Gulf, the first time to escort the US cruiser USS Princeton that had been seriously damaged by two mines and the second to escort the hospital ship Comfort and then protect her from floating mines. HMCS Athabaskan conducted slow patrols while Comfort was anchored.\u00a0\n\nWith the ceasefire, all three ships finished their assigned tasks and then headed for Dubai, entering the port on 3 March. Shortly thereafter they departed for Halifax, arriving to a tumultuous welcome on 7 April. The CF-18s returned to Baden, with the last aircraft leaving Doha on 9 March. At 10:00 AM on 16 April, HQ CANFORME closed its doors, thus ending Canadian participation in the Gulf War."}}, {"opName": "AXE", "countryRegion": "Iraq, Kuwait", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1991-03-01", "endDate": "1991-04-30", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/axe.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation AXE (Gulf War)", "International Mission Name": "Operation AXE (Gulf War)", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Location": "Kuwait, Iraq", "Mission Date": "1 March 1991 - 30 April 1991", "Mission Mandate": "To gather and examine Iraqi weapons to determine both what weapons Iraq had used and how effective they were.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " After the end of the war, Canadian army officers in Saudi Arabia traveled to Kuwait to gather arms and equipment abandoned by the Iraqis, under the name Operation AXE.

On 3 April the Security Council adopted Resolution 687, which set specific terms for the cease-fire and specified that the cease-fire would only come into formal effect once Iraq accepted the terms. Iraq accepted the terms on 6 April. The task of monitoring the cease-fire was given to the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM), created by Resolution 689 on 9 April 1991 and as recommended by the Secretary-General. UNIKOM would be of an unlimited duration. Although the Security Council would review the need for UNIKOM every six months, no formal decision would be required to extend the mission. However, the mission\u2019s termination would require a formal Security Council decision.\n\nUNIKOM\u2019s mandate was to monitor the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that ran along the land-border between Iraq and Kuwait, as well as the Khawr \u2018Abd Allah waterway between the two nations and report on violations. The DMZ is an almost barren land, 200-km long and extending 10 km into Iraq and 3 km into Kuwait. The only signs of human habitation in the zone are the oilfields in the zone and the Iraqi towns of Safwan and Umm Qasr.\n\nThe UNIKOM observers did not have the authority to prevent incursions or to take physical actions against the violators. In fact, being unarmed, the only option for the observers was to report such activities. The police forces of Iraq and Kuwait were responsible for security and could only carry side arms in the DMZ. Still, it was hoped that the mere presence of UNIKOM would deter border violations and hostile actions.\n\nThe UNIKOM advance party arrived in the area on 13 April. The remaining forces followed rapidly thereafter. By 6 May, UNIKOM was ready to supervise the withdrawal of the armed forces still in what was to become the DMZ. With the withdrawal rapidly completed, the DMZ came into effect on 9 May. UNIKOM was then able to assume its full responsibilities.\n\nUNIKOM\u2019s initial strength was 300 observers from 33 countries. In addition, the support elements totalled 155 persons from four nations and a Canadian Field Engineer unit of 301. To provide security during this initial phase, five infantry companies and one logistics company were drawn from the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, six nations providing these soldiers. They returned to Cyprus at the end of June 1991.\n\nFor operations, the DMZ was divided into three sectors. The southern one extended from the junction of the Iraq-Kuwait-Saudi Arabia border to a point just south of where the Iraq-Kuwait border turns east. The southern zone had 8 posts from which patrols were conducted. The northern sector continued from the end of the southern to the Khawr \u2018Abd Allah waterway. This sector had seven posts. The last sector was the maritime with three posts. In addition to these posts, UNIKOM operated temporary observation posts set up in areas where roads or tracks entered the DMZ. For the Khawr \u2018Abd Allah, UNIKOM operated helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. In the southern zone, mines and unexploded ordnance limited road movements. Patrols were frequently conducted by aircraft until tracks and roads were cleared.\n\nFrom May 1991 to January 1993 three main types of violations were noted in the DMZ: minor incursions by military personnel, overflights by military aircraft and policemen carrying weapons other than side-arms. In January 1993, Iraq began entering the DMZ and Kuwaiti territory to retrieve Iraqi property and military hardware. By this time, the number of observers was down to 250. The Secretary-General recommended that the number be brought up to 300 again and that three infantry battalions were required as a deterrent. Security Council Resolution 806 approved this plan. The Secretary-General subsequently reduced the requirement to one mechanised battalion. Bangladesh provided the battalion, while Kuwait equipped it. The battalion became operational on 5 February 1994.\n\nWith the deployment of the Bangladeshi troops, the situation along the border became calm again. There continued to be incidents and violations of the DMZ, plus one period of heightened tension when it was reported that Iraq was massing troops north of the DMZ. In March 1996, UNIKOM\u201ds strength was 245 observers and 1,111 infantry and support personnel from 32 countries.\n\nOn 17 March 2003, in advance of the American-led invasion of Iraq, the Secretary-General decided to suspend UNIKOM and withdraw its personnel. Most returned to their homes, with only a small detachment of 12 military and 20 civilian remaining in Kuwait City. UNIKOM remained suspended while the situation in Iraq became clear. On 6 October 2003 the Security Council dissolved UNIKOM.", "Name": "RECORD", "Date": "17 April 1991 - 15 August 2001", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " The Canadian Forces\u2019 participation in UNIKOM began with a request from the Secretary-General for one Lieutenant Colonel and an engineering regiment of up to 300. The LCol was to act as Deputy Chief of Staff at UNIKOM headquarters. The engineers were to clear areas for observation posts, make existing roads and tracks safe, and establish additional tracks to allow UNIKOM to patrol the DMZ, to perform minor construction and to assist in the supply and purification of water. On 17 April 1991 the operations order was issued for Operation RECORD. 1 Combat Engineer Regiment (1 CER) was tasked to deploy, augmented by personnel from across Canada. The LCol was also accepted, but would now be Deputy Chief Operations Officer for UNIKOM. Support for the Canadian Contingent UNIKOM would include a 16 person communications section from Canadian Forces Communications Command (CFCC), and logistical support by CC-130 Hercules from CFB Lahr flying two sustainment flights a month.\u00a0\n\nAlthough the engineers performed a variety of construction and engineering tasks, the most pressing need was mine clearance and disposal of unexploded ordnance (UXOs) to provide UNIKOM safe lanes for patrolling through the DMZ. While there were hundreds of thousands of mines, the bigger threat was UXOs. Although armed, many bombs and other explosives had failed to detonate when they hit the soft sand. Now with the temperatures rising as summer approached, they would heat up and explode of their own accord. Winds would blow UXOs onto previously cleared tracks, and as the sands shifted, more UXOs would be revealed.\u00a0\n\nThe Canadian engineers built over 1000 kms of new track but keeping the existing 2000 kms of tracks clear was also a major task as sand could drift to depths of 1.5 metres over the course of a day. With the winds blowing UXOs onto the tracks, daily inspections were required to ensure safety. On one occasion, a grader lost a tire to an UXO.\u00a0\n\n1 CER also built observation posts for UNIKOM observers. For the headquarters of each of the sectors, footings were poured for ATCO trailers, and sewage systems, communications towers and fencing installed. The other rotations conducted maintenance on or improvements to these facilities.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the engineers were requested to support the UN Boundary Commission, which was to mark the Iraq-Kuwait border. This was not part of their original mandate, but a vital task none-the-less. Canada approved this task, and the engineers were soon clearing the proposed boundary of mines and unexploded ordnance before the heavy equipment could build the tracks to allow the Boundary Commission to conduct their work and the engineers to install the markers. The first rotations of engineers helped install temporary markers while the final two rotations installed 106 permanent concrete border markers at 2 km intervals. Each pillar weighed 1800 kgs and could be seen for many kilometres.\u00a0\n\nThe Canadian commitment for engineer support was two years. Planning for rotation 1 and 2 began almost as soon as 1 CER had deployed. Consideration was now given to reducing the size of the contingent to 85 persons, with 5e R\u00e9giment du g\u00e9nie slated to deploy for rotation 1. 59e Escadron du g\u00e9nie de combat (59 EGC) from 5e R\u00e9giment du g\u00e9nie assumed control from 1 CER on 8 October 1991 and remained in theatre until 1 April 1992. The contingent consisted of 85 personnel.\u00a0\n\nThe CFCC personnel would also be rotated with rotation 1. Their numbers were reduced to six personnel, with later rotations involving fewer numbers. Their main role was to provide communications between the engineering contingent and the Canadian military observer, and Canada.\u00a0\n\nPlanning for rotation 2 also started in June 1991. 23 Field Engineer Squadron from 2 CER was tasked to provide the bulk of the 53 members. The 2 CER contribution deployed on 30 March 1992. One of their first tasks was to move the engineering logistics base from Doha to Umm Qasr, to be closer to their area of operation.\u00a0\n\nThe third and final rotation was again from 2 CER, and would consist of 44 personnel. The personnel began deploying at the start of October 1992, with one-third of the personnel being reservists from 2nd Field Engineer Regiment and 3rd Field Engineer Squadron. By mid-January the Canadian contribution had been reduced to 29 people as personnel were redeploying to Canada as the Canadian contribution was slowly wound down. The bulk of personnel from 2 CER left Kuwait on 27 March, to be replaced by an Argentine engineer squadron.\u00a0\n\nThe departure of the engineers did not end Canada\u2019s participation in UNIKOM. Besides the engineers and their accompanying communications personnel, Canada had provided one military observer to the UNIKOM headquarters. With the impending draw-down of the engineers, in November 1992 Canada indicated to the UN its willingness to increase the number of observers to a total of five. The UN requested this and approval was given at the start of March 1992 for these four additional observers.\u00a0\n\nEach Canadian observer was posted to UNIKOM for one year. Their duties were those of the original UN military observers. Op RECORD ended on 15 August 2001 when the last Canadian personnel left Kuwait.\n"}}, {"opName": "NECESSITY", "countryRegion": "Kuwait", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1991-03-03", "endDate": "1991-03-07", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/necessity.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Operation NECESSITY", "International Mission Name": "Operation NECESSITY", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Location": "Kuwait", "Mission Date": "3 March 1991 - 7 March 1991", "Mandate": "To restore the Embassy and the Ambassador\u2019s residence.\n\nMission Notes: By good fortune, the Canadian Ambassador to Kuwait left on vacation a few hours before Iraq\u2019s surprise invasion of the country.

Not only was there dissatisfaction with its sectarian based political structure, but there was also evidence that the newly created United Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria was supplying arms and agents to dissident factions. Civil war seemed imminent. Responding to a call from President Camille Chamoun, on 11 June 1958 the Security Council authorized the Secretary General to create an observer group to \u201censure that there is no illegal infiltration of personnel or supply of arms or other materiel across the Lebanese borders\u201d. Despite its mandate, which included the words \u201cto ensure,\u201d UNOGIL\u2019s role was strictly limited to observation and analysis: it had no authority to take action to prevent illegal infiltration or to arbitrate local disputes. However, the belief in New York was that a quick UN response would have an effect in and of itself, and to that end Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold requested UNTSO to provide UNOGIL\u2019s initial personnel. Accordingly, nine officers, including one Canadian, were made available and were in Beirut by 15 June; but the task of patrolling 278 miles of the Lebanon-Syria border was clearly beyond such a small group. UNOGIL grew in size, with Canada dispatching ten additional officers by 21 June. Seven more were dispatched in August, as UNOGIL\u2019s strength was increased to two hundred in order to cope with an even more perplexing situation resulting from Lebanon\u2019s direct request to the United States to provide American troops outside the UN framework to help prevent the outbreak of a civil war and to counter new threats based in Iraq and Jordan. They landed in mid-July, but their presence was not entirely helpful given American relations with some of Lebanon\u2019s neighbours. In an effort to expedite and smooth the withdrawal of the Americans, whose presence had clearly added to the tension, Hammarskjold recommended that the UNOGIL establishment be increased to five hundred, and to that end Canada provided an additional fifty-six officers and men. Other countries also increased their commitments, and accordingly It was in mid-November 1958 that UNMOGIL reached its peak strength of 591 personnel from twenty-countries manning forty-nine positions, manning eighteen surveillance aircraft and employing 290 vehicles for ground patrols. By 9 December the mission was largely over. The elections that had been held in July brought forward an administration that was acceptable to most factions; the Americans left Beirut on 25 October; normal diplomatic relations were being restored with the United Arab Republic; and on 17 November, the Lebanese government requested that UNOGIL be disbanded. UNOGIL itself made the same recommendation. As a result, the first Canadians left a week later and all had returned to Canada by Christmas. The Canadian contingent to UNOGIL numbered 77: 71 officers and 6 non-commissioned officers. One of the officers, a lieutenant-colonel, was in charge of UNOGIL\u2019s ground operations.

When on 13 April 1975 gunmen killed four members of the Phalangist (Christian) political party during an assassination attempt on Pierre Jumayyil, the Phalangist leader, it was widely believed that the gunmen had been Palestinian. Consequently, a group of Phalangists attacked a bus carrying Palestinians through a Christian area, killing about 26 of the passengers. The next day fighting erupted between Phalangists and Palestinians. The government could not act effectively as it became fractured over whether to use the army to suppress the fighting.

The Lebanese government was unable to prevent these incursions, as the country was in the midst of a civil war. On 11 March 1978, Al-Fatah launched a raid along the main coastal road in the north. Eleven terrorists landed in northern Israel, killing thirty-four Israelis and one American and injuring over seventy Israelis. They commandeered a bus and were stopped in a fierce gunfight with Israeli police north of Tel Aviv. In response, on the night of 14/15 March, Israel launched a four-pronged offensive into southern Lebanon. The Lebanese government submitted a strong protest to the Security Council, which subsequently issued a resolution on 19 March calling upon Israel to cease its military activities and withdraw from Lebanon. The resolution also called upon the Secretary-General to implement a United Nations interim force for Southern Lebanon, which became the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. The first UN forces to arrive in southern Lebanon were members of UNTSO. They were followed soon thereafter by an Iranian Company from UNDOF.

The Canadian op name was Operation ANGORA. The troop was composed mainly of personnel from the 1st Canadian Signals Regiment in Kingston with 12 augmentees from the Canadian Airborne Regiment. This initial group of 91 personnel commenced deployment on 18 April from CFB Trenton, and were all on the ground in Lebanon by 19 April. The Canadian Contingent was composed of two units: the Canadian Signal Unit UNIFIL (CSU-U) with 89 personnel, and the Chief Signal Officer UNIFIL with two personnel. The CSU-U was responsible for setting up the communications system between UNIFIL HQ and its deployed battalions. Initially, UNIFIL was to have five battalions and a logistics support unit, totaling 4,000 soldiers. The CSU-U thus found themselves stretched when they discovered that UNIFIL actually increased to 6,000 as a result of fighting between terrorists and UN forces in early May. As a result a further draft of twenty-six personnel arrived in theatre on 16 June. These personnel were recruited from around Canada and allowed the CSU-U to operate in a reasonable manner. Besides manning the UNIFIL communications net, manning the UNIFIL switchboard and operating the signals dispatch service, the CSU-U found themselves creating an increased communications net, providing local defence and security, and feeding UNIFIL HQ staff. On 12 July three Canadians were among a group of fifty-two UN soldiers captured by elements of the Palestine Liberation Organization. They were released unharmed after three hours, although several other UN soldiers were injured in the fighting. Of the 117 Canadians, two had a slightly different role - the Chief Signals Officer (CSO) and the Chief Communications Operator.

The next stop was in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), from 18 to 24 March where she participated in the annual International Defence Exhibition and again acted as host for SJSL and Canadian Embassy functions. Although originally intended as a rest and relaxation port, Fredericton\u2019s visit to Dubai, UAE, (24 to 27 March) included the obligatory functions. Canadians living in Dubai enjoyed the ship\u2019s hospitality and invited many sailors to spend the day with them or attend a desert barbecue. Enroute to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 5 April Fredericton responded to a distress call from the 15 metre sailing vessel Longo Barda off the Somali coast. The sailing boat, which was returning to Britain from a sailing race in Australia, was under attack from pirates. As it happened, the container ship Maersk Antwerp arrived on the scene first and forced the pirates to withdraw. The final official visit for the showcase was in Jeddah, from 8 to 10 April. After spending five days in Haifa, Israel, Fredericton headed back to Halifax on 17 April stopping briefly in Naples to pick up the conference table for the G7 Summit, being held in Canada in 1995. The ship returned to Halifax on 1 May."}}, {"opName": "BARRIER", "countryRegion": "Red Sea", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1991-04-04", "endDate": "2003-05-22", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/barrier.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Maritime Interdiction Force", "International Mission Name": "Maritime Interdiction Force", "Mandating Organization": "\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 661, 6 August 1990 (Chapter VII)\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 687, 3 April 1991 (Chapter VII)\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 1483, 22 May 2003", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Mission Date": "4 April 1991 - 22 May 2003", "Mission Mandate": " To enforce United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " On 6 August 1990, the United Nations Security Council placed economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait (resolution 661/1990).

In response, Iraq began dynamiting the offshore oil wells of the Kuwait Oil Company and, two days later began releasing oil from offshore terminals. Loaded oil tankers were also pre-positioned so that the oil could flow across the expected lines of approach of the United States Marines. The aim was to set the Gulf aflame. The result was a massive oil flow, the largest spill ever seen, which threatened valuable wildlife sanctuaries and sensitive ecological zones along a 300-km stretch of coast. Water desalinization plants, crucial to the people of the Western Gulf, were also threatened with contamination. Companies specializing in oil spill clean-up started arriving, but more needed to be done.\n\nOn 27 January, DND received a request to prepare a briefing on the oil spill for a meeting of the Government Planning Committee.

Burns", "Mission/Operation Notes": " The State of Israel was created on 14 May 1948 following United Nations acceptance of the Palestine Partition plan embodied in Resolution 181 adopted on 29 November 1947. Despite having broad international support Israel was attacked by its neighbours on 15 May 1948. The fighting continued into 1949 until the United Nations managed to broker ceasefire or armistice agreements with most of the belligerents. These agreements brought neither peace nor stability to the Middle East, however, because they did not resolve a fundamental problem: how to provide permanent, secure, and viable homelands for the Palestinians and Israelis in a way acceptable to all within the limited territories available for that purpose. Tensions remained high; there were calls on the parts of some governments for Israel\u2019s destruction; and when, in October 1956, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria announced the creation of a joint unified military command for their armed forces, the Israeli government was understandably alarmed. At the same time, relations between Egypt and the United States, United Kingdom, and France were deteriorating over the issue of access to the Suez Canal. Britain had given up its right to defend the Canal Zone and withdrawn from the area in June 1956. Shortly thereafter, the United States and the UK declined to help Egypt finance the Aswan dam project. On 26 July, therefore, Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal, announcing that transit fees would be used to finance the Aswan project.\u00a0\n\nBritain and France both regarded Egypt\u2019s seizure of the canal as a threat to their national security interests and as an attack on the rights of shareholders in the canal. By August they began planning an attack on Egypt to regain control of the Suez and, as part of a complex political manoeuvre, brought Israel into the plan as a co-belligerent.\u00a0\n\nIsrael attacked Egypt on 29 October. Britain and France then intervened on 31 October, ostensibly to separate the Egyptian and Israeli forces and ensure free passage for shipping through the Canal until a peace could be brokered; but some suspected that the British and French invasion forces would not soon leave. At the United Nations, the United States and the Soviet Union began immediate efforts to force a cease-fire and an Israeli withdrawal. An Extraordinary Meeting of the General Assembly was convened on 1 November, approving a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire. Fearing that any such cease-fire would be temporary, Lester Pearson, Canada\u2019s Secretary of State for External Affairs, promoted the idea of a UN force to separate the two combatants and to allow (and encourage) the British and French forces to withdraw. This idea gradually took form in General Assembly Resolutions 998 to 1000 on 4-5 November, which established an international emergency force under United Nations Command - what would soon become the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) - and appointed Major-General E.L.M. Burns of Canada as the force commander.\u00a0\n\nUNEF\u2019s mandate was to secure a cease-fire, supervise the withdrawal of foreign troops, and observe and patrol the armistice line. Militarily, UNEF was to prevent clashes between Egyptian and Israeli forces by interposing itself between the two sides. Despite the overwhelming support for Resolution 1000 in the UN General Assembly, Israel refused to allow UNEF forces onto its territory. Egypt agreed to their presence on Egyptian soil on condition that it was free to revoke its agreement at any time. It also insisted that UNEF troops stationed on Egyptian soil would have no authority over Egyptian territory or citizens.\u00a0\n\nBecause UNEF would have to leave when asked to do so by Egypt - and Israel had not accepted its presence on Israeli territory -- it was not the fully consensual effort usually upheld as the ideal of typical \u2018blue beret\u2019 peacekeeping; but in other ways it set the standard for all future such missions. It was UNEF, for example, which initially adopted the light blue headdress now viewed as the universal symbol of UN operations. More important, the idea of an armed force interposing itself between two combatants to keep the peace was born here, at least in the post-Second World War context.\u00a0\n\nThe first UN forces to arrive were from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization (UNTSO), which set up a temporary headquarters in Cairo from which to prepare for the UNEF forces. They arrived on 12 November and were followed on the 15th and 16th by Colombian, Danish and Norwegian forces who arrived in Egypt by air. By February 1957, UNEF comprised 6,073 personnel, from ten nations. This number decreased to 3,378 at the time of UNEF\u2019s withdrawal in May 1967. Indonesia and Finland had agreed to short-term commitments and withdrew their forces in September and December 1957. The Colombians withdrew in December 1958.\u00a0\n\nUNEF achieved its first objective relatively quickly. Once sufficient personnel were in place, and after some prompting by General Burns, the British and French started withdrawing from the Canal Zone in mid-December and were gone completely by 22 December. The withdrawal of Israeli forces took a little longer, but they too were gone by 22 January except for areas along Sharm el-Sheikh and the Gaza Strip, their place being taken by UNEF troops. In the case of the former, Israel wished to ensure that Egypt would not re-impose a blockade on Israeli access once it reoccupied the territory along the Gulf of Aqaba, but following negotiations and discussions at the UN, Israel withdrew from Sharm el-Sheik between 8 and 12 March. Israel\u2019s concerns about the Gaza Strip were related to its previous use as a staging point for guerrilla incursions into Israel. Again, after discussions, Israel withdrew from this area and UNEF forces entered the Gaza Strip on the night of 6/7 March.\u00a0\n\nBy then, UNEF was already heavily engaged in clearing minefields, repairing roads damaged during the fighting, overseeing prisoner of war exchanges and providing security for the British and French warships that cleared the Suez Canal itself of mines. But the major task was to ensure that fighting did not break out again, and to that end UNEF manned some eighty observations posts, conducted mobile patrols, and carried out air surveillance of the frontier region.\u00a0\n\nFor ten years UNEF had great success in keeping the Israeli-Egyptian frontier secure, and the number of incidents there paled in comparison with those occurring on Israel\u2019s borders with Jordan and Syria. But by 1967 the level of tension throughout the region was rising (control of water in the headwaters of the Jordan River and increased terrorist activity directed against Israel from bases in Syria and Jordan were particular problems) and on 16 May 1967, as was his right, the Egyptian President ordered UNEF to leave his country. The Six-Day war began three weeks later, on 5 June, and fifteen UNEF personnel (fourteen Indian and one Brazilian) still in the Gaza Strip awaiting repatriation were killed as fighting occurred around them. When the war was over, Israel was left in possession of the entire Sinai peninsula, Gaza, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights, and UNTSO returned to the new Egyptian-Israeli frontier to resume its monitoring mission.", "Name": "United Nations Emergency Force I", "Date": "6 November 1956 - 31 May 1967", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " The Canadian government naturally supported the Pearson UNEF proposal, and plans to contribute a Canadian contingent to UNEF were well underway before Resolution 1000 was formally adopted. It was assumed in Ottawa that Canada would send an infantry battalion - 1st Battalion, The Queen\u2019s Own Rifles of Canada - but she had also been asked for support elements and an armoured reconnaissance squadron. The plan was designated Operation RAPID STEP, and because of the changes noted below, three quite separate contingencies end up being covered by that name. RAPID STEP 1 was the proposed deployment of 1 QOR; RAPID STEP 2 covered the actual force despatched between November 1956 and January 1957; and RAPID STEP 3 dealt with the armoured recce squadron sent in March 1957. RAPID STEP 1 began on 7 November 1956, when the aircraft carrier HMCS Magnificent was ordered back to Halifax at best speed to serve as transport for the Canadian contingent. Arriving in Halifax on 13 November, she underwent a rapid transformation to allow army stores to be loaded, a task that was completed by 18 November. Awaiting the \u201cMaggie\u201d were the 950 men of 1 QOR who had been flown from Calgary to Halifax by 435 Squadron in a two-day period starting November 13th.\u00a0\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Own would not deploy once Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser objected to their selection because - the story goes - their name was too British-sounding and their uniforms too British-looking. It has been suggested, however, that these were simply excuses, and that what was important to Nasser was that he be able to show to his own people that Egypt had not surrendered its sovereignty by accepting UNEF and that it could still exert national control by insisting upon certain conditions. In this interpretation, The Queen\u2019s Own were simply a handy and a useful target. Whatever the reason - and it must be remembered not only that all Canadian Army uniforms at the time closely resembled British uniforms, but also that several Regiments and Corps in the Canadian Army carried the word Royal in their title - on 11 December Canada agreed that 1 QOR would not deploy, and Operation RAPID STEP 1 came to a close. Over the next week, all the embarked stores were disembarked.\u00a0\n\nIn the meantime, General Burns had suggested that Canada should despatch logistics personnel, of which UNEF was desperately short, and his proposal was agreed to. Thus began RAPID STEP 2. Once again HMCS Magnificent was loaded with materiel and equipments and with nearly five hundred officers and men primarily from the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals, Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps, and Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers as well as four de Havilland Otter aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force. She slipped her lines on 29 December and departed for the Middle East, arriving off Port Said on 12 January 1957. In the meantime, RCAF Transport Command airlifted the remaining personnel to Italy beginning 21 November and then, in Operation READY LIFT, began ferrying Canadian and other UN personnel to Abu Suweir, Egypt. North Stars from 426 Squadron made the trans-Atlantic crossing, while C-119 Boxcars crewed by 435 and 436 Squadrons flew across the Mediterranean. Twelve Boxcars were eventually committed to the task, and by the end of December they had carried 1712 passengers and 306 tons of freight.\u00a0\n\nEight of the C119s returned to Canada in January, but the RCAF maintained a strong presence in the area with four Boxcars of what was now designated No 114 Communications Flight as well as the two Dakotas and four Otters No 115 Communications Flight. The former, now renamed No 114 Air Transport Unit, left for Canada in January 1958, while the Dakotas of No 115 Air Transport Unit were eventually replaced by DHC-4 Caribou. These, like all the other aircraft deployed with UNEF, had their Canadian markings muted or removed altogether, to be replaced by the words United Nations on the sides of the fuselage.\u00a0\n\nThe land component, meanwhile, was organised in four newly created units reflecting the functional nature of the Canadian commitment: 56 Canadian Signal Squadron, 56 Canadian Transport Company, 56 Canadian Infantry Workshop and Canadian Base Units, Middle East. Subsequently, when it was found that UNEF lacked a light reconnaissance capability, 56 Canadian Recce Squadron, formed largely from Lord Strathcona\u2019s Horse (Royal Canadians) and The Royal Canadian Dragoons, was created and despatched under the designation RAPID STEP 3. It deployed to the Middle East in March 1957, and with its arrival the strength of CANUNEF stood at 1007, all ranks. Its initial task was to occupy a buffer zone between the Egyptian Army and the Anglo-French forces waiting to withdraw. The first to enter this zone were engineers who, from 1 December 1956, began the risky job of clearing mines. Once the foreign forces had withdrawn from Egypt, the main tasks of the Canadians were to conduct reconnaissance, monitor the armistice line, investigate violations and maintain a \u201cUN\u201d presence. 115 ATU meanwhile conducted aerial reconnaissance flights, resupplied UNEF troops, and transported UNEF senior personnel to meetings in Egypt and Israel.\n\nIn time UNEF\u2019s presence produced sufficient stability on the Sinai frontier to allow the UN to reduce its size. The Canadian Recce Squadron was not replaced at the end of its 1966 tour, while the amalgamation of the infantry workshop and transport company into Canadian Base Unit (UNEF) in October 1963 had already reduced Canada\u2019s commitment to 780 personnel.\u00a0\n\nWhen Egypt demanded that UNEF leave its territory on 16 May 1967, Canada was among the countries that tried to persuade President Nasser to rescind his request. But when these attempts proved fruitless, the UN had to react, and withdrawal was the only course of action. The RCAF began to evacuate the Canadian contingent on 29 May, finishing the job two days later. The Six Day War began on 5 June.\u00a0\n\nThe United Nations presence in the Middle East was not able to prevent the outbreak of war in 1967, but it does not follow that UNEF itself had failed. Rather, in a region alive with tension, UNEF had managed to make the Sinai perhaps the most secure and stable frontier area of all, and that was no minor accomplishment. Thirty-one Canadians died on UNEF service, most in vehicular accidents."}}, {"opName": "RAPID STEP", "countryRegion": "Sinai", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1956-11-05", "endDate": "1967-06-17", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/rapid-step.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Emergency Force I", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Emergency Force I (UNEF I)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Location": "Sinai", "Mission Date": "5 November 1956 - 17 June 1967", "Mission Mandate": " UNEF I was established to secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of France, Israel and the United Kingdom from Egyptian territory and, after the withdrawal, to serve as a buffer between the Egyptian and Israeli forces.

North Stars from 426 Squadron made the trans-Atlantic crossing, while C-119 Boxcars crewed by 435 and 436 Squadrons flew across the Mediterranean. Twelve Boxcars were eventually committed to the task, and by the end of December they had carried 1712 passengers and 306 tons of freight. Eight of the C119s returned to Canada in January, but the RCAF maintained a strong presence in the area with four Boxcars of what was now designated No 114 Communications Flight as well as the two Dakotas and four Otters No 115 Communications Flight. The former, now renamed No 114 Air Transport Unit, left for Canada in January 1958, while the Dakotas of No 115 Air Transport Unit were eventually replaced by DHC-4 Caribou. These, like all the other aircraft deployed with UNEF, had their Canadian markings muted or removed altogether, to be replaced by the words United Nations on the sides of the fuselage. The land component, meanwhile, was organised in four newly created units reflecting the functional nature of the Canadian commitment: 56 Canadian Signal Squadron, 56 Canadian Transport Company, 56 Canadian Infantry Workshop and Canadian Base Units, Middle East. Subsequently, when it was found that UNEF lacked a light reconnaissance capability, 56 Canadian Recce Squadron, formed largely from Lord Strathcona\u2019s Horse (Royal Canadians) and The Royal Canadian Dragoons, was created and despatched under the designation RAPID STEP 3. It deployed to the Middle East in March 1957, and with its arrival the strength of CANUNEF stood at 1007, all ranks. Its initial task was to occupy a buffer zone between the Egyptian Army and the Anglo-French forces waiting to withdraw. The first to enter this zone were engineers who, from 1 December 1956, began the risky job of clearing mines. Once the foreign forces had withdrawn from Egypt, the main tasks of the Canadians were to conduct reconnaissance, monitor the armistice line, investigate violations and maintain a \u201cUN\u201d presence. 115 ATU meanwhile conducted aerial reconnaissance flights, resupplied UNEF troops, and transported UNEF senior personnel to meetings in Egypt and Israel. In time UNEF\u2019s presence produced sufficient stability on the Sinai frontier to allow the UN to reduce its size. The Canadian Recce Squadron was not replaced at the end of its 1966 tour, while the amalgamation of the infantry workshop and transport company into Canadian Base Unit (UNEF) in October 1963 had already reduced Canada\u2019s commitment to 780 personnel. When Egypt demanded that UNEF leave its territory on 16 May 1967, Canada was among the countries that tried to persuade President Nasser to rescind his request. But when these attempts proved fruitless, the UN had to react, and withdrawal was the only course of action. The RCAF began to evacuate the Canadian contingent on 29 May, finishing the job two days later. The Six Day War began on 5 June. The United Nations presence in the Middle East was not able to prevent the outbreak of war in 1967, but it does not follow that UNEF itself had failed. Rather, in a region alive with tension, UNEF had managed to make the Sinai perhaps the most secure and stable frontier area of all, and that was no minor accomplishment. Thirty-one Canadians died on UNEF service, most in vehicular accidents."}}, {"opName": "READY LIFT", "countryRegion": "Sinai", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1956-11-05", "endDate": "1967-06-17", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/ready-lift.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Emergency Force I", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Emergency Force I (UNEF I)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Location": "Sinai", "Mission Date": "5 November 1956 - 17 June 1967", "Mission Mandate": " UNEF I was established to secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of France, Israel and the United Kingdom from Egyptian territory and, after the withdrawal, to serve as a buffer between the Egyptian and Israeli forces.

Burns", "Mission/Operation Notes": " The State of Israel was created on 14 May 1948 following United Nations acceptance of the Palestine Partition plan embodied in Resolution 181 adopted on 29 November 1947. Despite having broad international support Israel was attacked by its neighbours on 15 May 1948. The fighting continued into 1949 until the United Nations managed to broker ceasefire or armistice agreements with most of the belligerents. These agreements brought neither peace nor stability to the Middle East, however, because they did not resolve a fundamental problem: how to provide permanent, secure, and viable homelands for the Palestinians and Israelis in a way acceptable to all within the limited territories available for that purpose. Tensions remained high; there were calls on the parts of some governments for Israel\u2019s destruction; and when, in October 1956, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria announced the creation of a joint unified military command for their armed forces, the Israeli government was understandably alarmed. At the same time, relations between Egypt and the United States, United Kingdom, and France were deteriorating over the issue of access to the Suez Canal. Britain had given up its right to defend the Canal Zone and withdrawn from the area in June 1956. Shortly thereafter, the United States and the UK declined to help Egypt finance the Aswan dam project. On 26 July, therefore, Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal, announcing that transit fees would be used to finance the Aswan project. Britain and France both regarded Egypt\u2019s seizure of the canal as a threat to their national security interests and as an attack on the rights of shareholders in the canal. By August they began planning an attack on Egypt to regain control of the Suez and, as part of a complex political manoeuvre, brought Israel into the plan as a co-belligerent. Israel attacked Egypt on 29 October. Britain and France then intervened on 31 October, ostensibly to separate the Egyptian and Israeli forces and ensure free passage for shipping through the Canal until a peace could be brokered; but some suspected that the British and French invasion forces would not soon leave. At the United Nations, the United States and the Soviet Union began immediate efforts to force a cease-fire and an Israeli withdrawal. An Extraordinary Meeting of the General Assembly was convened on 1 November, approving a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire. Fearing that any such cease-fire would be temporary, Lester Pearson, Canada\u2019s Secretary of State for External Affairs, promoted the idea of a UN force to separate the two combatants and to allow (and encourage) the British and French forces to withdraw. This idea gradually took form in General Assembly Resolutions 998 to 1000 on 4-5 November, which established an international emergency force under United Nations Command - what would soon become the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) - and appointed Major-General E.L.M. Burns of Canada as the force commander. UNEF\u2019s mandate was to secure a cease-fire, supervise the withdrawal of foreign troops, and observe and patrol the armistice line. Militarily, UNEF was to prevent clashes between Egyptian and Israeli forces by interposing itself between the two sides. Despite the overwhelming support for Resolution 1000 in the UN General Assembly, Israel refused to allow UNEF forces onto its territory. Egypt agreed to their presence on Egyptian soil on condition that it was free to revoke its agreement at any time. It also insisted that UNEF troops stationed on Egyptian soil would have no authority over Egyptian territory or citizens. Because UNEF would have to leave when asked to do so by Egypt - and Israel had not accepted its presence on Israeli territory -- it was not the fully consensual effort usually upheld as the ideal of typical \u2018blue beret\u2019 peacekeeping; but in other ways it set the standard for all future such missions. It was UNEF, for example, which initially adopted the light blue headdress now viewed as the universal symbol of UN operations. More important, the idea of an armed force interposing itself between two combatants to keep the peace was born here, at least in the post-Second World War context. The first UN forces to arrive were from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization (UNTSO), which set up a temporary headquarters in Cairo from which to prepare for the UNEF forces. They arrived on 12 November and were followed on the 15th and 16th by Colombian, Danish and Norwegian forces who arrived in Egypt by air. By February 1957, UNEF comprised 6,073 personnel, from ten nations. This number decreased to 3,378 at the time of UNEF\u2019s withdrawal in May 1967. Indonesia and Finland had agreed to short-term commitments and withdrew their forces in September and December 1957. The Colombians withdrew in December 1958. UNEF achieved its first objective relatively quickly. Once sufficient personnel were in place, and after some prompting by General Burns, the British and French started withdrawing from the Canal Zone in mid-December and were gone completely by 22 December. The withdrawal of Israeli forces took a little longer, but they too were gone by 22 January except for areas along Sharm el-Sheikh and the Gaza Strip, their place being taken by UNEF troops. In the case of the former, Israel wished to ensure that Egypt would not re-impose a blockade on Israeli access once it reoccupied the territory along the Gulf of Aqaba, but following negotiations and discussions at the UN, Israel withdrew from Sharm el-Sheik between 8 and 12 March. Israel\u2019s concerns about the Gaza Strip were related to its previous use as a staging point for guerrilla incursions into Israel. Again, after discussions, Israel withdrew from this area and UNEF forces entered the Gaza Strip on the night of 6/7 March. By then, UNEF was already heavily engaged in clearing minefields, repairing roads damaged during the fighting, overseeing prisoner of war exchanges and providing security for the British and French warships that cleared the Suez Canal itself of mines. But the major task was to ensure that fighting did not break out again, and to that end UNEF manned some eighty observations posts, conducted mobile patrols, and carried out air surveillance of the frontier region. For ten years UNEF had great success in keeping the Israeli-Egyptian frontier secure, and the number of incidents there paled in comparison with those occurring on Israel\u2019s borders with Jordan and Syria. But by 1967 the level of tension throughout the region was rising (control of water in the headwaters of the Jordan River and increased terrorist activity directed against Israel from bases in Syria and Jordan were particular problems) and on 16 May 1967, as was his right, the Egyptian President ordered UNEF to leave his country. The Six-Day war began three weeks later, on 5 June, and fifteen UNEF personnel (fourteen Indian and one Brazilian) still in the Gaza Strip awaiting repatriation were killed as fighting occurred around them. When the war was over, Israel was left in possession of the entire Sinai peninsula, Gaza, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights, and UNTSO returned to the new Egyptian-Israeli frontier to resume its monitoring mission.", "Name": "READY LIFT", "Date": "6 November 1956 - 17 June 1967", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " The Canadian government naturally supported the Pearson UNEF proposal, and plans to contribute a Canadian contingent to UNEF were well underway before Resolution 1000 was formally adopted. It was assumed in Ottawa that Canada would send an infantry battalion - 1st Battalion, The Queen\u2019s Own Rifles of Canada - but she had also been asked for support elements and an armoured reconnaissance squadron. The plan was designated Operation RAPID STEP, and because of the changes noted below, three quite separate contingencies end up being covered by that name. RAPID STEP 1 was the proposed deployment of 1 QOR; RAPID STEP 2 covered the actual force despatched between November 1956 and January 1957; and RAPID STEP 3 dealt with the armoured recce squadron sent in March 1957. RAPID STEP 1 began on 7 November 1956, when the aircraft carrier HMCS Magnificent was ordered back to Halifax at best speed to serve as transport for the Canadian contingent. Arriving in Halifax on 13 November, she underwent a rapid transformation to allow army stores to be loaded, a task that was completed by 18 November. Awaiting the \u201cMaggie\u201d were the 950 men of 1 QOR who had been flown from Calgary to Halifax by 435 Squadron in a two-day period starting November 13th. The Queen\u2019s Own would not deploy once Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser objected to their selection because - the story goes - their name was too British-sounding and their uniforms too British-looking. It has been suggested, however, that these were simply excuses, and that what was important to Nasser was that he be able to show to his own people that Egypt had not surrendered its sovereignty by accepting UNEF and that it could still exert national control by insisting upon certain conditions. In this interpretation, The Queen\u2019s Own were simply a handy and a useful target. Whatever the reason - and it must be remembered not only that all Canadian Army uniforms at the time closely resembled British uniforms, but also that several Regiments and Corps in the Canadian Army carried the word Royal in their title - on 11 December Canada agreed that 1 QOR would not deploy, and Operation RAPID STEP 1 came to a close. Over the next week, all the embarked stores were disembarked. In the meantime, General Burns had suggested that Canada should despatch logistics personnel, of which UNEF was desperately short, and his proposal was agreed to. Thus began RAPID STEP 2. Once again HMCS Magnificent was loaded with materiel and equipments and with nearly five hundred officers and men primarily from the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals, Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps, and Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers as well as four de Havilland Otter aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force. She slipped her lines on 29 December and departed for the Middle East, arriving off Port Said on 12 January 1957. In the meantime, RCAF Transport Command airlifted the remaining personnel to Italy beginning 21 November and then, in Operation READY LIFT, began ferrying Canadian and other UN personnel to Abu Suweir, Egypt.

Twelve Boxcars were eventually committed to the task, and by the end of December they had carried 1712 passengers and 306 tons of freight. Eight of the C119s returned to Canada in January, but the RCAF maintained a strong presence in the area with four Boxcars of what was now designated No 114 Communications Flight as well as the two Dakotas and four Otters No 115 Communications Flight.

More important, the idea of an armed force interposing itself between two combatants to keep the peace was born here, at least in the post-Second World War context. The first UN forces to arrive were from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization (UNTSO), which set up a temporary headquarters in Cairo from which to prepare for the UNEF forces. They arrived on 12 November and were followed on the 15th and 16th by Colombian, Danish and Norwegian forces who arrived in Egypt by air. By February 1957, UNEF comprised 6,073 personnel, from ten nations. This number decreased to 3,378 at the time of UNEF\u2019s withdrawal in May 1967. Indonesia and Finland had agreed to short-term commitments and withdrew their forces in September and December 1957. The Colombians withdrew in December 1958. UNEF achieved its first objective relatively quickly. Once sufficient personnel were in place, and after some prompting by General Burns, the British and French started withdrawing from the Canal Zone in mid-December and were gone completely by 22 December. The withdrawal of Israeli forces took a little longer, but they too were gone by 22 January except for areas along Sharm el-Sheikh and the Gaza Strip, their place being taken by UNEF troops. In the case of the former, Israel wished to ensure that Egypt would not re-impose a blockade on Israeli access once it reoccupied the territory along the Gulf of Aqaba, but following negotiations and discussions at the UN, Israel withdrew from Sharm el-Sheik between 8 and 12 March. Israel\u2019s concerns about the Gaza Strip were related to its previous use as a staging point for guerrilla incursions into Israel. Again, after discussions, Israel withdrew from this area and UNEF forces entered the Gaza Strip on the night of 6/7 March. By then, UNEF was already heavily engaged in clearing minefields, repairing roads damaged during the fighting, overseeing prisoner of war exchanges and providing security for the British and French warships that cleared the Suez Canal itself of mines. But the major task was to ensure that fighting did not break out again, and to that end UNEF manned some eighty observations posts, conducted mobile patrols, and carried out air surveillance of the frontier region. For ten years UNEF had great success in keeping the Israeli-Egyptian frontier secure, and the number of incidents there paled in comparison with those occurring on Israel\u2019s borders with Jordan and Syria. But by 1967 the level of tension throughout the region was rising (control of water in the headwaters of the Jordan River and increased terrorist activity directed against Israel from bases in Syria and Jordan were particular problems) and on 16 May 1967, as was his right, the Egyptian President ordered UNEF to leave his country. The Six-Day war began three weeks later, on 5 June, and fifteen UNEF personnel (fourteen Indian and one Brazilian) still in the Gaza Strip awaiting repatriation were killed as fighting occurred around them. When the war was over, Israel was left in possession of the entire Sinai peninsula, Gaza, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights, and UNTSO returned to the new Egyptian-Israeli frontier to resume its monitoring mission."}}, {"opName": "GLADIUS", "countryRegion": "Syria", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1974-05-31", "endDate": "2019-02-23", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/gladius.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF)", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations Security Council Resolution 350, 31 May 1974", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Location": "Syria", "Mission Date": "31 May 1974 - Present", "Canadian Operation": " Op DANACA - 3 June 1974 to 24 March 2006 Op GLADIUS - 24 March 2006 - ongoing", "Mandate": " United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) was established by Security Council resolution 350 (1974) of 31 May 1974 to maintain the ceasefire between Israel and Syria, to supervise the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces, and to supervise the areas of separation and limitation, as provided in the Agreement on Disengagement.", "Mission Notes": " On 6 October 1973, the Yom Kippur War started when Egypt and Syria, in a coordinated effort supported by troops of other Arab nations, attacked Israel. After initial setbacks, Israel was able to regain lost ground. Along the Syrian border, Israel was able to retake the Golan Heights and captured additional Syrian territory beyond that taken in the Six Day War of 1967. Diplomatic activity was intense during the conflict, with the possibility of a showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union. A cease-fire was accepted by Israel and Syria, taking effect on this front on 22 October (26 October along the Egyptian front). In response to the cease-fire, the United Nations set-up temporary observation posts for military observers from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization (UNTSO). Tensions remained high and there were continuous violations of the cease-fire. These involved artillery, armour, mortar, rockets and automatic weapons fire. The UNTSO observers were able to re-establish the cease-fire in each case. United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was able to negotiate an Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria, the signing of which took place on 31 May 1974.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim had been kept informed of the progress of the talks in Geneva. On 30 May he provided the Security Council with the text of the Agreement, and its Protocol, which called for a United Nations force to supervise the implementation of the Agreement. On 31 May, the Security Council passed resolution 350, which called for the creation of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).\u00a0\n\nUNDOF was set up with a six-month mandate, subject to concurrence from the Security Council, Israel and Syria. Its role was to supervise the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces, and then maintain the cease-fire, and supervise the Agreement and Protocol with respect to the areas of limitation and separation. UNDOF personnel were to comply with Syrian laws and regulations and not hamper the local Syrian civil authorities. UNDOF personnel were to enjoy freedom of movement and communication, and were only permitted to carry the firearms necessary for self-defence.\n\nThe Agreement established an area of separation and an area of limitation. The former is a demilitarized zone controlled by UNDOF, approximately 80 km long and from one wide in the south the to eight km wide in the north. The latter is an area of Israeli or Syrian territory in which the number and type of military personnel and equipment is restricted. The Agreement also allows Syrian civilians to return to their homes in the area of separation.\n\nThe initial personnel for UNDOF started to arrive on 3 June 1974. These were the Austrian and Peruvian infantry battalions from UNEF II, the United Nations Emergency Force II that had been established in the Sinai to supervise the cease-fire there. They were followed the next day by elements drawn from the Canadian and Polish logistics units of UNEF II. By 16 June, UNDOF had 1,218 personnel.\u00a0\n\nOnce in place, UNDOF\u2019s observers were quickly employed observing the disengagement of the two forces, which occurred between 14 and 27 June. From 25 to 27 June, 500 Syrian soldiers cleared mines in the area of separation, an operation that required and was given Israeli approval. Unfortunately, four Austrian soldiers had been killed on 25 June when their vehicle ran over a land mine.\u00a0\n\nOnce these operations were complete, UNDOF undertook the delineation and marking of the borders to the area of separation. This was completed by July 1974. Checkpoints and observation posts were also established, with two base camps, one on either side of the area of separation.\u00a0\n\nTo carry out its mandate, UNDOF uses the observation posts as well as foot and mobile patrols. Even though there have been periodic mine-clearing operations, the threat from mines remains high. UNDOFpatrols therefore keep to established paths and roads. Fortnightly inspections are also conducted of each side\u2019s military forces in the area of limitation.\n\nUNDOF has also assisted in humanitarian operations. From time to time UNDOF has arranged the transfer of prisoners of war and the bodies of war dead between Israel and Syria. For a period from 1976 to 1982 UNDOF supervised the periodic reunion of Druze families who were separated by the border running through the area of separation. The reunions occurred in the village of Majdel Chams in the area of separation.\n\nAlthough there have been some major incidents, resulting in casualties to civilians in the area of separation, and involving Syrian personnel laying mines in the area, UNDOF has been successful in resolving problems along the border between Israel and Syria. There have been occasional restrictions placed on UNDOF\u2019s operations by both sides; however, these have not seriously hindered UNDOF\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nThe mandate of UNDOF has since been renewed every six months. UNDOF\u2019s membership and strength have undergone a few changes since the original deployment. In July 1975, the Peruvian contingent was withdrawn, replaced by an Iranian contingent. The Iranians in turn withdrew and were replaced by a Finnish contingent in March 1979. In December 1993, the Polish logistics contingent and the Finnish infantry battalion were withdrawn. A Polish infantry battalion replaced the Finns and the Canadian logistics contingent was strengthened. A transport platoon from Japan joined UNDOF in February 1996, while Slovak soldiers began to be incorporated into the Austrian battalion in the late 1990s. Observers from UNTSO are also attached to UNDOF.\n\nUNDOF\u2019s overall strength was reduced by 15 percent in all units in 1992, and consisted of 1,054 observers in March 1996: 463 Austrians, 358 Polish, 188 Canadian and 45 Japanese. In 1999, the Austrians had reduced to 393, but were complemented by the addition of 70 Slovak personnel. Infantry personnel from Nepal also participate in UNDOF. There are also four UNTSO observers attached to UNDOF and another 85 assisting, but belonging to UNTSO\u2019s Observer Group Golan.\n\nThe Canadian contribution to UNDOF commenced on 3 June 1974 when a 40-vehicle convoy left the Sinai and drove through Israel to the Golan Heights. They set up in camp near the Syrian town of Kuneitra in the area of separation, in a former Syrian military camp that had been a French Foreign Legion camp in the 1920s. Their new home was initially nicknamed Camp Roofless by the Canadians, mainly because all buildings except one had been made roofless as a result of the 1967 and 1973 wars. Camp Ziouani, as it became officially known, had to be cleared of unexploded ordnance before it could be used.\n\nThe Canadian contingent was initially a detached company from 73 Service Battalion from UNEF. As a result, the Canadian contingent had the same operation name as that of the Canadian contingent in UNEF \u2013 Op DANACA. This UNDOF detachment was under the technical and administrative control of a UNEF unit. On 8 June 1977, the Canadian UNDOF detachment gained its technical and operational independence, becoming the Canadian Logistics Company (CANLOG) and reporting to UNDOF headquarters. Administrative control for Canadian issues remained with the Canadian Contingent Administrative Unit in Ismailia until 1979, when UNEF was disbanded. Thereafter CANLOG reported to the Canadian Contingent Commander UNDOF and maintained the name Op DANACA.\n\nThe Canadians, along with the Polish logistics contingent (POLLOG), provided logistical support to UNDOF. UNDOF\u2019s infantry battalions are responsible for minor repairs of their own vehicles and equipment (first-line maintenance). While the POLLOG was part of UNDOF, they provided second-line maintenance for Soviet-origin equipment, while CANLOG provided this service for western-origin. With the withdrawal of POLLOG, Canada took over all second-line maintenance functions. The Canadian contingent has been responsible for the requisitioning, storage and distribution of all UN supplied items, furniture and office equipment, construction materials and UN-supplied clothing. This includes purchasing and supplying rations to all UNDOF contingents.\n\nCanada also provides communications personnel (a Signals Troop) and facilities to the various UNDOF detachments. The 28 personnel provide not only the radio communications, but also operate the UNDOF telephone system. For the Canadian contingent, the Signals Troop provides communications back to Canada, as well as e-mail services. Sixteen of Canada\u2019s personnel serve in UNDOF headquarters, primarily in the logistics section.\n\nInitially, Canada provided second-line transport in Israel. Poland conducted the same service in Syria. POLLOG personnel could not enter Israel, as Poland did not recognize Israel at that time. With the withdrawal of the POLLOG, Canada took over all transport duties until the arrival of the Japanese contingent (JAPCON), who took over the transport and heavy equipment functions.\n\nThe Canadian contingent UNDOF is also responsible for providing support to the Canadian personnel serving with UNTSO. Canadian UNTSO personnel report to Camp Ziouani for in-clearances and briefings before reporting to UNTSO headquarters and operational deployment with UNTSO.\n\nCanada\u2019s initial contribution to UNDOF was 226 personnel. This was scaled back to 186, as UNDOF has been reduced in size in 1992 and 1993. There was a slight increase in strength with the withdrawal of POLLOG. Personnel for Op DANACA are selected from units across Canada for a six-month deployment. Half of the contingent is rotated every three months. Four Canadian personnel have died while on UNDOF service.\u00a0\n\nOp DANACA came to an end on 24 March 2006. The Government of Canada had conducted a comprehensive review of its overseas operations and decided to reduce its participation once a suitable replacement nation could be found. India agreed to replace the Canadian UNDOF contingent.\n\nCanada\u2019s commitment to UNDOF did not, however, end with the Op DANACA. Initially four officers remained in staff positions with UNDOF. This was reduced to two in July 2006, the officers filling the positions of Military Assistant to the UN Commander and Chief of Personnel. This new CF operation was named Operation GLADIUS, and commenced on 24 March 2006."}}, {"opName": "United Nations Yemen Obervation Mission", "countryRegion": "Yemen", "continent": "Middle East", "startDate": "1963-06-11", "endDate": "1964-09-04", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/middle-east/united-nations-yemen-observation-mission.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "United Nations Yemen Observation Mission", "International Mission Name": "United Nations Yemen Observation Mission (UNYOM)", "Mandating Organization": "United Nations", "Region Name": "Middle East", "Location": "Yemen", "Mission Date": "11 June 1963 - 4 September 1964", "Mission Mandate": " UNYOM was established on 11 June 1963 by Security Council Resolution 179 (1963), to observe and certify the implementation of the disengagement agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Republic.", "Mission/Operation Notes": " In Yemen on 17 September 1962 Colonel Abdullah al-Salal overthrew the monarchy of Imam Mohahmmed al Badr, who had just taken over from his deceased father. United Arab Republic promptly recognized the new government, while the United Nations and the United States followed suit by the end of December. Salal\u2019s control of the country was not complete, however, and royalist or anti-Salal, rose in revolt. Saudi Arabia supported these royalist elements with arms and military equipment; Egypt responded by supplying Salal with arms, men, and equipment. In early 1963, United Nations Secretary-General U Thant became concerned about the situation in Yemen. With the approval of the three states involved, Thant sent Ralph Bunche on a fact-finding mission to Egypt and Yemen, while the United States sent Ellsworth Bunker to Saudi Arabia on a related task. By April, both men reported to Thant that an agreement had been reached on the terms for a disengagement of Egyptian and Saudi support from Yemen. The terms of the agreement were that Saudi Arabia would cease its support of and deny the use of Saudi territory to the royalists while Egypt, for its part, would withdraw its forces. In addition, a 20-km wide demilitarized zone would be established on either side of the Saudi-Yemeni border. An observer force would confirm compliance of the terms of agreement. The Security Council approved these plans for what would become UNYOM on 11 June. The initial expectation was that the mission would last four months. Egypt and Saudi Arabia agreed to pay for the operation for two months and would only approve two-month extensions for the life of the mission. Personnel for UNYOM were in place and ready to start the operation on 20 July. At its maximum, there were 189 personnel, with 11 countries contributing, Canada and Yugoslavia providing the largest contingents.

The UN, meanwhile, offered three Otters from ONUC, the UN operation in the Congo. RCAF technicians were flown there from Canada, disassembled the three machines, loaded them onto USAF C-130 Hercules aircraft, and then reassembled them in Aden. The Canadian advance party of five persons for UNYOM arrived in Sanaa on 22 June, the new unit being designated No. 134 Air Transport Unit. The main party of 40 departed Trenton on 22 June by 437 Squadron Yukon to Pisa and Hercules to Sanaa on 25 June. The Caribous were to be used for transport, resupply and reconnaissance, while the Otters were used for reconnaissance on a daily basis out of Najran and Jizan. In November, the Canadian contingent was reorganized. The Otter detachment at Jizan was withdrawn, its responsibilities being taken over by the Caribou. Then, on 15 December, 134 ATU became a detachment of 115 ATU (UNEF), and the establishment reduced to 28. The Otters were withdrawn from use entirely. Further changes occurred in late February when the UN agreed to allow the Caribou to based out of El Arish and make a weekly circuit. This continued until operations ceased on 4 September 1964. UNYOM cannot be considered to have been a success. While both parties had agreed to a disengagement, both violated the terms, and when Egypt and Saudi Arabia together raised objections to their continued financing of UNYOM the UN made no effort to extend its mandate past September 1964.

However, the treaty did not come into effect until 1 January 2002, after the last of the signatories ratified the treaty. Originally, there were 22 signatories, but that number is increasing. The treaty allows signatories to conduct overflights of other signatory states in unarmed military aircraft.

The sensors include optical framing and panoramic cameras, video cameras and synthetic aperture radars, with infra-red line scanners coming into use in 2006.

CARDE was conducting studies on the composition of the atmosphere using infra-red equipment on high-latitude balloons. In addition, Canada had a very useful aircraft for the program. The CF-100 Canuck could reach an altitude of 45,000 feet while equipped in its tip tanks with instruments designed for infra-red detection. It also could carry a heavy payload, had an excellent range and was extremely stable. On 21 September 1959, Air Force Headquarters authorized participation in Operation LOOKOUT, as the Canadian portion of the tests were called. By this time, the ARPA program had been transferred to the USAF. RCAF participation would include two CF-100 Canucks, two flight crews and 24 airmen, plus two defence scientists from CARDE. They would deploy to Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. On 8 January 1960, the two CF-100s (serial numbers 18439 and 18453) flew to the island on the island, accompanied by a 426 Squadron North Star and a C-119 from 436 Squadron carrying the airmen and scientists. During operations from Ascension, the CF-100s measured the infra-red emissions from nose cones re-entering the atmosphere.\u00a0 The second phase would extend from April to June 1961 from Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, where the CF-100s would measure the plume from launches. On tracking flights the CF 100s worked as a team with C-119 and U-2 sensing aircraft. Phase III would continue the work of Phase II, from Patrick AFB and also were be made from Eleuthera, Mayaguana and San Salvador downrange in the Bahamas, commencing September 1961.\u00a0 On 20 February 1962, the CF-100s at an altitude of 40,000 feet observed the launch of astronaut John Glenn into space. Other astronaut launches included those of Alan Sheppard, Walter Schirra, Scott Carpenter and Gordon Cooper. During the Lookout missions, and as a favour to NASA, the CF-100s also tested the infra-red scanner that was later deployed on the Nimbus weather satellite.

Last erupting in 1845, the top of the volcano was covered in a vast snow field and ice pack. Situated about 50 kilometres east of the volcano was the town of Armero, population 27,000, situated in a valley leading off the volcano\u2019s slopes. The citizens of the town and surrounding villages were aware that the volcano was awakening, having felt rumblings over the past year. At 3:00 PM on 13 November, Nevado del Ruiz started erupting \u2013 with pumice and ash raining down on Armero two hours later. The local Red Cross initiated an evacuation order at 7:00 PM; however, shortly thereafter, the volcanic eruption apparently stopped. The evacuation was halted. With the people of the town snug in their beds, Nevado del Ruiz began discharging lava at 9:00 PM. This melted the vast snow and icefields on the peak and slopes. A storm obscured the top of the volcano, preventing citizens from observing the eruption. The resulting meltwater raced down the valleys off the volcano\u2019s slopes, picking up boulders, mud and debris in its rush \u2013 a phenomenon known as a lahar. When it reached the town of Armero two hours later, the lahar was 30 metres high and carrying boulders 10 metres in size. The town was literally swept away, burying over 23,000 people in 3 to 5 metres of mud.

Overall, 66,794 people perished and 800,000 were left homeless. That evening the President of Peru, Juan Velasco Alvarado, requested international assistance.", "Canadian Task Force Mission Statement": " To deliver humanitarian aid to Peru.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " At the request of the Department of External Affairs, the CF performed a staff check and advised that the dispatch of five Caribou, and one Hercules as support, would be the most valuable contribution. The Prime Minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, approved this suggestion on 5 June. 424 Squadron had been placed on alert the day before. On 6 June, all six aircraft departed CFB Trenton, and via Florida and Panama, arrived in Peru in the evening of 8 June after a 6 100 kilometer journey. The first real missions began on 9 June when, and having taken on Peruvian pilots as guides, the crews of the four Caribous called upon carefully tossed out bundles of blankets and clothing to stranded villages along the route. Anta, the only airfield in the disaster area to remain open, was the hub of the relief effort. To reach this area, the pilots had to fly at over 14,500 feet to cross a mountain range, fly through windy, steep-sided valleys before coming down at a steep angle of descent onto the 3,000 foot gravel runway, located at an elevation of 8,700 feet. The danger of the flying can be judged by the fact that in the first week, three American helicopters, one Argentinean Fokker F-27, and one Peruvian helicopter had already crashed in the valleys and mountain passes. The pace of activities was intense. Given the complete breakdown of the electrical grid, the Anta valley was pitch black from about 4:00 PM, and all flying had therefore to be squeezed into the daylight hours. Given the limited space on the airfield, moreover, there was no time or space to loiter, and the goal was to load and unload in under twenty minutes. By Monday, 15 June, LCol Butchart called a one-day halt to operations to let air and ground crew rest. Both were tired from the long days and from the high altitude. By that time, 49 flights had been made bringing in over 90 tons of relief and evacuating over 800 people. The initial flights brought in relief supplies and took out the injured. The initial supplies were mainly plasma, hypodermics, vaccines and plaster-of-paris. Priority then shifted to food, drinking water, blankets and warm, clothes to aid survivors until the roads could be re-opened. Operations into Anta resumed on 16 June, but the effort to open roads and new airfields went ahead very quickly and by 20 June an airfield at Caras, north of Yanguay, was opened, although its 1500 foot runway limited access to Caribous and helicopters. Two days later, the runways at Anta were lengthened to allow French Air Force Transalls and American Hercules to land there, expanding the relief effort. Still, the unique STOL capabilities and high lift capacity of the Caribous made them extremely useful in opening transport to new fields. Airlift was not the only Canadian Forces contribution to the disaster relief effort. On 14 June, a group of 12 technicians arrived aircraft from Canada to install seven donated electrical generators. One generator arrived by Hercules on 14 June, with the remaining six arriving on two Hercules on 16 June. After assembling the generators, the decision was made on 18 June to send three to the City of Trujillo, for which the generators departed by road and the four technicians by air. A further three were installed in the Huaraz area and one in Santiago de Chuco, the technicians and generators taking roads to these locations. The last relief flight occurred on 26 June. By that time there had been 97 flights, involving 382 flying hours, carrying over 180 tons of emergency supplies and transporting 1903 homeless, injured and orphaned civilians out of the disaster area. The last personnel from 424 Squadron left on 30 June, followed by the last of the technicians on 14 July."}}, {"opName": "(Peru 1991)", "countryRegion": "Peru", "continent": "South America", "startDate": "1991-06-24", "endDate": "1991-06-27", "url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/past-operations/south-america/peru-1991.html", "details": {"International Operation Name": "Peru 1991", "International Mission Name": "Peru 1991", "Mandating Organization": "Government of Canada", "Region Name": "South America", "Location": "Peru", "Mission Date": "24 June 1991 - 27 June 1991", "Canadian Task Force Mission Statement": " To deliver medical supplies and equipment to Peru to help combat a cholera outbreak and epidemic.", "CF Mission/Operation Notes": " In January 1991, cholera began to sicken people in the village of Chancay, 60 kilometres from Lima, Peru.
